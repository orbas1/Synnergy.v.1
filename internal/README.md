# Internal Packages

This directory hosts application code that is not intended to be imported by external modules. Packages placed here represent the core building blocks of the Synnergy platform and are subject to change without notice.

Subdirectories will organize internal logic by domain, including:
- `core`: foundational blockchain logic, consensus and state management.
- `nodes`: implementations of specialized network nodes.
- `tokens`: token and asset management.
- `crosschain`: interoperability and bridge functionality.
- `security`: authentication, authorization, and defense modules.

Only binaries within this repository should import packages from `internal/`.
