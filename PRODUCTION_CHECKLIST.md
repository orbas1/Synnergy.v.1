# Production Release Checklist

This checklist consolidates all tasks required to prepare and ship a production release of Synnergy.
Complete each section before tagging a new version.

## 1. Planning & Scope
- [ ] Confirm feature freeze and ensure all stories for the release are closed.
- [ ] Review open issues and merge or defer remaining pull requests.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a summary of new features, fixes, and breaking changes.
- [ ] Assign release owners and communication channels for the rollout.

## 2. Code Quality
- [ ] Run `go fmt` on all Go sources and ensure no stray files remain (`git status` clean).
- [ ] Execute static analyzers (`go vet`, `staticcheck`, `gofmt -s`) and fix any findings.
- [ ] Verify module boundaries and import paths conform to project guidelines.
- [ ] Ensure deprecations are clearly marked and unused code removed.

## 3. Dependency Management
- [ ] Execute `go mod tidy` and `go mod verify` to lock module versions.
- [ ] Review third‑party licenses and update attribution files if required.
- [ ] Rotate API keys, certificates, and credentials used in development environments.

## 4. Testing
- [ ] Run unit tests with race detector: `go test -race ./...`.
- [ ] Execute integration and end‑to‑end tests (`tests/` and `scripts/`).
- [ ] Run fuzz tests for critical cryptographic and networking components.
- [ ] Generate test coverage reports and ensure thresholds are met.
- [ ] Validate cross‑platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows; amd64/arm64).

## 5. Security
- [ ] Run static security scanners such as `gosec` and address warnings.
- [ ] Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `govulncheck`).
- [ ] Ensure secrets are not committed and environment variables are documented.
- [ ] Review access controls and permission sets for all services.
- [ ] Obtain a peer security review or external audit for major changes.

## 6. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Execute benchmark suite (`go test -bench ./...`).
- [ ] Perform load testing on critical paths (transaction throughput, consensus, storage).
- [ ] Compare results against previous releases and update performance budgets.
- [ ] Profile CPU, memory, and I/O to spot regressions.

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update user and operator guides under `docs/`.
- [ ] Verify API references and schema definitions are current.
- [ ] Add upgrade notes and migration steps if data formats or APIs changed.
- [ ] Ensure README and quick‑start guides reference the latest release artifacts.

## 8. Infrastructure & Deployment
- [ ] Build and push Docker images for each service.
- [ ] Verify Kubernetes/Helm manifests and Terraform modules apply cleanly.
- [ ] Run database migrations on staging and document rollback procedures.
- [ ] Confirm backup and restore strategies are tested.
- [ ] Validate configuration files for production (secrets, endpoints, quotas).

## 9. Observability
- [ ] Confirm structured logging is enabled at appropriate levels.
- [ ] Expose Prometheus metrics and verify dashboards/alerts in Grafana.
- [ ] Ensure OpenTelemetry traces are emitted and collected.
- [ ] Test health and readiness probes in orchestration environments.

## 10. Compliance & Legal
- [ ] Validate license headers and SPDX identifiers where required.
- [ ] Review export controls and regional compliance considerations.
- [ ] Archive meeting notes and design decisions for audit purposes.

## 11. Release Execution
- [ ] Tag the repository using semantic versioning.
- [ ] Generate and sign release artifacts with checksums.
- [ ] Publish packages, Docker images, and documentation to official channels.
- [ ] Announce the release to the community and stakeholders.

## 12. Post‑Release
- [ ] Monitor telemetry and error rates for early regression detection.
- [ ] Triage and address user‑reported issues promptly.
- [ ] Create follow‑up tasks for deferred features or fixes.
