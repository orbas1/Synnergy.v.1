# AGENTS Tasks

This repository requires the following eight tasks to be executed simultaneously. Each task includes detailed sub tasks.

1. **Transaction Fee Distribution (4.4.8.1)**
   - Implement fee sharing model for validators and miners.
   - Compute proportional fee shares.
   - Automate smart contract-based distribution with real-time processing.
   - Analyze economic impact to encourage full blocks and adapt to network conditions.

2. **Gas Fee Framework (4.4.8.2)**
   - Define principles for fair, efficient, and sustainable gas fee calculation.
   - Develop base fee algorithm using the median of the last 1000 blocks and an adjustment factor.
   - Implement variable fee computation based on gas units and gas price per unit.
   - Support priority fees (tips) and detailed fee calculations for transfers, purchases, deployed token usage, contract signing, wallet verification, and validated fee-less transfers.

3. **Security Measures (4.4.8.3)**
   - Enforce minimum stake requirements for validators.
   - Implement multi-factor validation tasks: transaction verification and block signing.
   - Apply slashing conditions for double signing and downtime with penalties and rehabilitation procedures.

4. **Fee Distribution Strategy & Genesis Wallets (4.4.8.4-5)**
   - Redistribute fees to internal development, charitable contributions, loan pool, passive income for holders, validators/miners, node hosts, and creator wallet.
   - Manage genesis wallets for incentives and ongoing ecosystem support: genesis, internal/external charity, loan pool, passive income, node host distribution, creator wallet.

5. **Dynamic Fee Adjustment & Transparent Estimator (4.4.8.6-7)**
   - Monitor network conditions and algorithmically adjust base and variable fee rates.
   - Provide real-time fee estimator with interactive UI, data synchronization, and fee breakdown.
   - Communicate updates and gather user feedback for continuous optimization.

6. **Extended Fee Controls (4.4.8.8)**
   - Implement fee caps to prevent overcharging during congestion.
   - Apply fee floors to guarantee minimum validator compensation.
   - Automate monitoring and transparent communication of fee thresholds.

7. **Advanced Transaction Features (4.4.8.9-10)**
   - Integrate biometric authentication via APIs, CLIs, GUIs, and SDKs.
   - Optimize transaction broadcasting and relay through efficient algorithms, P2P propagation, relay nodes, and queue management.

8. **Transaction Control, Privacy & Receipt Management (4.4.8.11-13)**
   - Enable cancellation, reversal, and scheduling with authority node oversight.
   - Support conversion to private transactions using encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, and authority verification.
   - Provide chargebacks and detailed, searchable transaction receipts with secure storage.

All tasks should be tackled concurrently to deliver a secure, efficient, and user-friendly transaction system.
