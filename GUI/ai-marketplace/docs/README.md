# Neto Solaris — AI Marketplace Documentation

The **AI Marketplace** module provides a foundational interface for exchanging AI services and datasets across the Synnergy Network. Developed and maintained by Neto Solaris, this component delivers a lightweight HTTP service and flexible scaffolding for building production‑ready marketplace features. The module is intentionally small to act as a reference implementation that teams can clone or extend when building bespoke trading venues for algorithms, models, or analytics data.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The service is implemented in TypeScript and transpiled to Node.js. At its core, the [`main.ts`](../src/main.ts) file exposes an HTTP endpoint that returns a simple health message (`ai-marketplace alive`) and is intended to be extended with real marketplace logic. An in‑memory key–value store (`state/store.ts`) demonstrates basic state management used in both unit and end‑to‑end tests.

The project structure encourages a clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
  components/   # Reusable UI elements for marketplace front ends
  hooks/        # Shared logic for data retrieval and stateful utilities
  pages/        # Route-level components mapped to URLs
  services/     # Connectors for external APIs and network protocols
  state/        # Shared in-memory store implementation
  styles/       # Global and component CSS resources
```

This scaffolding allows teams to progressively introduce full marketplace capabilities while maintaining a modular architecture. Directories such as `components/`, `hooks/`, `pages/`, and `services/` are intentionally left empty so development teams can populate them with domain-specific interfaces, state handlers, and integrations.

The HTTP layer relies solely on Node's built-in `http` module and binds to the port supplied via the `PORT` environment variable. When executed directly, [`main.ts`](../src/main.ts) emits a startup message indicating the effective port. The request handler can be expanded to support additional routes by inspecting `req.url`:

```typescript
import http from 'http';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/health') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }).end('ok');
    return;
  }
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }).end('ai-marketplace alive');
});
```

State management is provided through [`state/store.ts`](../src/state/store.ts), a minimal in-memory key–value utility exposing `set`, `get`, and `reset` methods. The design keeps behaviour deterministic for unit and end‑to‑end tests and can be swapped for a persistent database in production. Compilation settings in [`tsconfig.json`](../tsconfig.json) enforce strict typing, source maps, and consistent module resolution, yielding robust JavaScript output in `dist/`.

### Core Runtime Modules
- **`src/main.ts`** – creates the HTTP server and accepts an optional port argument for embedding in larger applications.
- **`src/state/store.ts`** – provides a singleton in-memory store for simple key–value persistence.
- **`config/production.ts`** – defines runtime configuration sourced from `API_URL` and `PORT` environment variables.
- **`jest.config.js`** – configures Jest with TypeScript support and coverage collection.

### Extending the Service
The request handler can be expanded to expose domain features. The example below demonstrates a route that stores and retrieves a value using the in-memory store:

```typescript
import { store } from './state/store';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url?.startsWith('/save/')) {
    const [, key, value] = req.url.split('/');
    store.set(key, value);
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }).end('saved');
    return;
  }
  if (req.url?.startsWith('/get/')) {
    const [, key] = req.url.split('/');
    const data = store.get<string>(key) || 'missing';
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }).end(data);
    return;
  }
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }).end('ai-marketplace alive');
});
```

This pattern keeps the codebase framework-agnostic while allowing teams to layer in routing libraries or application frameworks as requirements grow.

## 2. Project Layout

Beyond the `src/` directory, the repository includes a concise set of folders that drive the development lifecycle:

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `config/` | Runtime profiles such as [`production.ts`](../config/production.ts) |
| `tests/` | Jest unit (`tests/unit/`) and end‑to‑end (`tests/e2e/`) suites |
| `docs/` | Markdown documentation, including this guide |
| `ci/` | GitHub Actions workflow definition |
| `k8s/` | Example Kubernetes manifests |
| `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml` | Containerisation artefacts for local or cloud deployments |
| `Makefile` | Convenience targets wrapping common npm commands |

This layout mirrors typical Neto Solaris projects, offering a consistent developer experience across the Synnergy ecosystem.

---

## 3. Configuration

Runtime configuration is centralized in `config/` files. The production profile (`config/production.ts`) reads the following environment variables:

- `API_URL` – Base URL for Synnergy network services (default: `https://api.synnergy.example`).
- `PORT` – HTTP port exposed by the server (default: `3000`).

Environment variables can be supplied directly, via Docker Compose, or through Kubernetes manifests. Additional configuration profiles (for example, `development.ts` or `staging.ts`) can be introduced in the same directory to reflect different deployment targets.

The `main` function in [`src/main.ts`](../src/main.ts) also accepts an explicit port argument, enabling programmatic embedding or override of the `PORT` variable when invoked from other modules.

Example of starting the service on a custom port:

```bash
npm run build
PORT=8081 API_URL=https://api.synnergy.example npm start
```

---

## 4. Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation & Local Run
```bash
npm install      # or: make install
npm run build    # or: make build
npm start        # launches the HTTP service
```
The default server responds on `http://localhost:3000` and can be tested with any HTTP client.

### Available Scripts
| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript sources to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Execute compiled server (`dist/main.js`) |
| `npm test` | Run unit and end‑to‑end Jest suites |
| `npm run lint` | Lint source with ESLint |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Prettier |

A simple `Makefile` wraps the install, build, and test operations for convenience. Prior to opening a pull request, execute `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to ensure code quality and consistent styling across the Neto Solaris codebase.

### Code Style Guidelines
The codebase adheres to a strict TypeScript configuration (`strict: true` in [`tsconfig.json`](../tsconfig.json)) and ESLint rules enforced by [`npm run lint`](../package.json). Prettier maintains consistent formatting across files. Commits should follow the conventional message format (`type: summary`) used across Neto Solaris repositories.

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

Jest is configured through [`jest.config.js`](../jest.config.js) to execute tests located in both `src/` and `tests/` directories while collecting coverage metrics. The configuration uses the `ts-jest` preset so TypeScript sources run without a separate compilation step and targets the Node runtime defined in `testEnvironment`.

Example suites illustrate different testing layers:

- **`src/main.test.ts`** – spins up the HTTP server on an ephemeral port and asserts that the response body equals `ai-marketplace alive`.
- **`tests/unit/example.test.ts`** – validates that calling `reset` on the store clears previously persisted keys.
- **`tests/e2e/example.e2e.test.ts`** – exercises the store across calls to `set` and `get`, mimicking a lightweight end‑to‑end flow.

To run the full test suite:
```bash
npm test    # or: make test
```

Coverage reports can be generated with:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

To continuously run tests during development, append the `--watch` flag:
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

---

## 6. Containerization & Deployment

### Docker
The included [`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) builds a minimal production image:
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

A companion `docker-compose.yml` file exposes the application on port 3000 and demonstrates how to set `API_URL` and `PORT` environment variables for local development.
To build and run the image manually:

```bash
docker build -t ai-marketplace .
docker run -p 3000:3000 ai-marketplace
```

Using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes
A sample deployment manifest resides in `k8s/deployment.yaml`. It provisions a single replica of the service, mapping container port `3000` and allowing further customization through standard Kubernetes mechanisms. Adjust the `image` field to reference a registry-hosted image and scale `replicas` to match workload requirements. Environment variables can be injected via `env` entries or ConfigMaps and Secrets.

---

## 7. Continuous Integration

Automated builds are defined in `ci/pipeline.yml` using GitHub Actions. The workflow triggers on changes within the `GUI/ai-marketplace` path and performs the following steps:
1. Check out source code.
2. Install dependencies with `npm ci`.
3. Execute unit tests via `npm test`.
4. Compile the project with `npm run build`.

This pipeline ensures consistency across contributions and provides rapid feedback for pull requests.
The workflow runs on Ubuntu with Node.js 18 provided by `actions/setup-node` and can be extended with additional jobs for linting, security scanning, or publishing container images.

---

## 8. Security & Compliance

The module currently exposes only a health endpoint and does not persist data, yet future marketplace features should account for:

- **Secret management** – never commit API keys or credentials. Use environment variables or secret stores.
- **Transport security** – terminate TLS at the ingress layer or front proxy when deployed.
- **Access controls** – integrate with Synnergy identity services before enabling write operations.
- **Code quality** – run `npm run lint` and `npm test` locally before submitting changes.
- **Dependency hygiene** – review `package.json` regularly and apply updates to address upstream vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability scanning** – execute `npm audit` or integrate dependency scanners in CI to catch known issues early.

Review the repository-wide [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before reporting vulnerabilities or engaging with the community.

## 9. Contributing & Support

Contributions are welcome. Please review the repository-wide [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for guidelines. Issues and feature requests can be submitted through the project tracker under the Neto Solaris organization.

For security concerns, consult the global [SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md) policy before reporting vulnerabilities.
When submitting patches, ensure that tests and linters pass locally and use descriptive commit messages following the conventional `type: summary` format.

---

## 10. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

Planned areas of exploration include:

- Marketplace listings backed by persistent databases and pricing engines.
- Authentication flows aligned with Synnergy identity wallets.
- Rich UI components for browsing and purchasing AI services.
- Observability hooks for metrics and centralized logging.
- Payment settlement integrations supporting on-chain and off-chain transactions.
- Governance features for rating vendors and flagging inappropriate content.
- Dataset lifecycle management with provenance tracking and version history.

Community feedback is welcome—open an issue to propose additional features or integrations.

---

## 11. Monitoring & Observability

While the reference implementation emits basic console logs, production deployments should integrate with centralized logging and metrics platforms. Recommended practices include:

- Forwarding stdout/stderr to a log aggregation service such as ELK, Grafana Loki, or CloudWatch.
- Exposing Prometheus-compatible metrics for request throughput, latency, and error rates.
- Configuring health and readiness probes in Kubernetes to surface runtime status.

---

## 12. Performance & Scalability

The baseline service is intentionally lightweight. For production workloads, consider the following to meet performance objectives:

- **Horizontal scaling** – run multiple instances behind a load balancer or Kubernetes deployment and tune `replicas` accordingly.
- **Clustering** – leverage Node's `cluster` module or process managers like PM2 to utilize multi-core hosts.
- **Caching** – introduce an external cache (e.g., Redis) when repeated computations or network calls become expensive.
- **Persistent stores** – replace the in-memory store with a database when durability or query capabilities are required.

Benchmarking early and often helps determine whether the simple HTTP stack suffices or if a full-featured framework is warranted.

---

## 13. Error Handling & Logging

Comprehensive logging accelerates root-cause analysis and post-mortem reviews:

- Wrap asynchronous handlers with try/catch blocks and return meaningful HTTP status codes.
- Standardize log formats (JSON or key/value) to ease parsing in downstream systems.
- Redact sensitive data before emitting logs, especially in multi-tenant environments.

For structured logging, consider integrating libraries such as `pino` or `winston`.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `EADDRINUSE` error on startup | Another service is using the configured `PORT`. Stop the process or supply a different port. |
| Requests hang without response | Ensure `npm run build` has been executed and that the server is listening on the expected port. |
| Tests fail with missing TypeScript types | Run `npm install` to restore dependencies and verify that `tsconfig.json` includes all source directories. |
