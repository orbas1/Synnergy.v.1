 Node
1 Node introduction
In the Synthron blockchain, nodes play a critical role in maintaining the network's integrity, security, and performance. Various types of nodes with distinct functions ensure that the network remains decentralized, robust, and capable of handling a diverse range of transactions and smart contracts. Below, we provide a detailed overview of each node type utilized within the Synthron blockchain ecosystem, which will be included in the whitepaper to give stakeholders a clear understanding of the network's architecture.
1.1. Validator Node
Validator Nodes are central to the functionality and security of the Synnergy Network blockchain. They validate transactions and state changes, and play a critical role in the governance of the network's protocol updates and consensus mechanism. This section details the operational framework, stringent requirements, advanced technical specifications, and comprehensive security measures necessary for running a Validator Node on the Synnergy Network. The Synnergy Consensus mechanism, which is a hybrid of Proof of History (PoH), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Proof of Work (PoW), is utilized by these nodes. Validator Nodes can selectively enable or disable any of these consensus mechanisms based on their computational capabilities and preferences.
Purpose and Core Functions
Validator Nodes serve three primary functions within the Synnergy Network blockchain:
1. Transaction Validation: Validator Nodes scrutinize every transaction for legitimacy and adherence to the blockchain's rules. This includes verifying signatures, checking transaction syntax, and ensuring state transitions are correct based on the existing blockchain ledger.
2. Block Creation and Propagation: These nodes participate in the creation of new blocks. When chosen by the network's consensus algorithm (based on factors like stake amount, node uptime, and historical accuracy), they gather transactions from the mempool, form a block, and broadcast it to other nodes.
3. Consensus Building: Validator Nodes are pivotal in achieving network consensus on the state of the ledger. They vote on proposed blocks and changes to the protocol, effectively governing the network through a democratic mechanism where decisions are made based on the collective agreement of active validators.
