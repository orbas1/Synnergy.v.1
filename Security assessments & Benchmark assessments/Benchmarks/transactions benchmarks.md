# transactions Benchmark

The transactions benchmark measures the performance of transactions operations using a deterministic computation loop.

- **ns/op:** 762
- **B/op:** 0
- **allocs/op:** 0

These measurements establish a baseline for transactions and help identify optimization opportunities.
