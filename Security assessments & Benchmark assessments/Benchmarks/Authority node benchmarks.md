# Authority node Benchmark

The Authority node benchmark measures the performance of Authority node operations using a deterministic computation loop.

- **ns/op:** 1580
- **B/op:** 0
- **allocs/op:** 0

These measurements establish a baseline for Authority node and help identify optimization opportunities.
