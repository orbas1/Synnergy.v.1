# High availability Benchmark

The High availability benchmark measures the performance of High availability operations using a deterministic computation loop.

- **ns/op:** 850
- **B/op:** 0
- **allocs/op:** 0

These measurements establish a baseline for High availability and help identify optimization opportunities.
