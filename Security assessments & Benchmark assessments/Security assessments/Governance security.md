# Governance Security Assessment

## Overview
Governance mechanisms allow stakeholders to propose and vote on protocol changes. The integrity of this process determines how safely the network can evolve without centralization or manipulation.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Vote manipulation or bribery** that skews outcomes against community interest.
- **Low participation or quorum hijacking** allowing small groups to dictate policy.
- **Smart‑contract vulnerabilities** in governance modules leading to unauthorized proposals.
- **Opaque decision records** undermining transparency and accountability.
- **Inadequate identity verification** enabling Sybil voting.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Implement token‑weighted or identity‑based voting with delegation transparency.
- Require minimum quorum thresholds and time‑locked execution of decisions.
- Conduct audits and formal verification of governance smart contracts.
- Publish immutable records of proposals, discussions, and vote tallies.
- Use identity attestations or staking requirements to deter Sybil participation.

## Security Testing
Simulation environments model voting scenarios and edge cases. Audits and bug bounties focus on governance contracts, while live monitoring detects abnormal voting patterns.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Transparent processes, secure contracts, and active community participation ensure governance remains resilient and representative in enterprise settings.
