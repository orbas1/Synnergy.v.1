# Treasury Security Assessment

## Overview
The treasury manages accumulated fees and reserves that fund network operations. Because it holds significant value, compromising the treasury could jeopardize the entire ecosystem.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Private key theft** leading to unauthorized withdrawals.
- **Misallocation of funds** due to governance flaws or insider abuse.
- **Smart‑contract vulnerabilities** in treasury management code.
- **Lack of transparency** reducing stakeholder oversight.
- **Concentration of control** in a small set of administrators.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Store treasury keys in hardware modules with multi‑signature requirements.
- Tie disbursements to transparent governance processes and community review.
- Audit and formally verify treasury contracts before deployment.
- Publish real‑time dashboards and periodic financial reports.
- Distribute control among independent entities with clearly defined roles.

## Security Testing
Regular penetration tests and key‑ceremony drills validate wallet security. Audits examine governance and contract logic, while monitoring tools track treasury balances for anomalies.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Transparent operations, strong key management, and audited code ensure the treasury can safely steward network resources.
