# Authority Node Security Assessment

## Overview
Authority nodes validate transactions and participate in governance. They hold elevated privileges and cryptographic keys, making them prime targets for adversaries seeking control over network consensus or administrative actions.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Compromise of validator keys** leading to fraudulent block signing.
- **Misconfiguration** exposing management interfaces or insecure networking.
- **Denial‑of‑service attacks** that disrupt consensus participation.
- **Insider threats** abusing privileged access for unauthorized changes.
- **Supply‑chain risks** from unvetted software or firmware updates.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Secure key storage using hardware security modules and enforce key rotation.
- Harden node configurations, disable unused services, and require VPN or SSH bastions for management access.
- Deploy DDoS protection, rate limiting, and redundant nodes to maintain availability.
- Implement strict change‑management processes and activity logging to deter insider abuse.
- Verify integrity of software updates and maintain an allow‑list of trusted sources.

## Security Testing
Routine penetration tests target exposed services and key management workflows. Configuration audits, vulnerability scanning, and failover drills confirm resilience. Red‑team exercises emulate insider and external threats.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
By safeguarding keys, hardening configurations, and continuously testing defenses, authority nodes can uphold network trust in real‑world deployments.
