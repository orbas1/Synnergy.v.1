# Loan Pool Security Assessment

## Overview
The loan pool module manages collateralized lending, matching borrowers with liquidity providers. Financial data and smart‑contract execution require strict controls to prevent fraud and protect assets.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Oracle manipulation** affecting collateral valuations and liquidation thresholds.
- **Liquidity draining attacks** exploiting flash loans or withdrawal bugs.
- **Borrower default without adequate collateral tracking**.
- **Exposure of borrower identities** violating privacy requirements.
- **Administrative key compromise** enabling unauthorized parameter changes.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Utilize multiple trusted oracles with medianization to determine asset prices.
- Implement withdrawal limits, time locks, and reentrancy guards on pool contracts.
- Monitor collateral ratios in real time and trigger automated liquidations.
- Pseudonymize borrower data and enforce access controls on sensitive records.
- Protect administrative keys with multi‑sig schemes and continuous monitoring.

## Security Testing
Smart‑contract audits focus on lending logic and oracle integrations. Economic stress tests simulate market volatility and attack scenarios. Penetration tests review access to borrower information and administrative interfaces.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Through resilient oracles, guarded contract design, and robust oversight, the loan pool can operate securely for enterprise‑grade lending.
