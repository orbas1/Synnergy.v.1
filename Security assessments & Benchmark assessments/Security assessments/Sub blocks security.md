# Sub‑Blocks Security Assessment

## Overview
Sub‑blocks partition larger blocks into smaller units for parallel processing or sharding. They must maintain integrity and ordering to ensure final block correctness.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Cross‑shard replay attacks** replaying transactions between sub‑blocks.
- **State inconsistency** if dependencies across sub‑blocks are not properly enforced.
- **Tampering with sub‑block metadata** leading to invalid aggregates.
- **Denial of service** by flooding specific shards or sub‑block queues.
- **Complex synchronization logic** introducing race conditions or deadlocks.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Incorporate unique identifiers and nonces to prevent replay across shards.
- Validate inter‑shard dependencies before final block assembly.
- Sign sub‑block headers and verify integrity during aggregation.
- Rate limit submissions per shard and provide adaptive load balancing.
- Design deterministic synchronization protocols with thorough testing.

## Security Testing
Sharding simulations verify replay resistance and state consistency. Stress tests target individual shards, while code reviews focus on synchronization and aggregation logic.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Careful design and exhaustive testing of sub‑block handling preserve scalability gains without sacrificing security.
