# AI Security Assessment

## Overview
The AI subsystem drives predictive analytics and automation across the Synnergy Network. It processes sensitive training data and makes decisions that can influence on‑chain transactions, making its confidentiality, integrity, and availability paramount.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Privilege escalation** within AI services enabling unauthorized model manipulation.
- **Model or dataset exfiltration** through insecure storage or API endpoints.
- **Adversarial input and model poisoning** that degrade accuracy or introduce backdoors.
- **Insecure third‑party libraries** or dependencies introducing supply‑chain risk.
- **Insufficient audit trails** preventing effective incident response and forensics.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce strong authentication, MFA, and role‑based access controls for all AI operators.
- Encrypt models and datasets at rest and in transit with centralized key management.
- Validate and sanitize inputs; perform adversarial testing before deployment.
- Pin and monitor third‑party dependencies and apply timely security patches.
- Aggregate logs in tamper‑evident storage with continuous monitoring and alerting.

## Security Testing
Automated unit and integration tests validate model behavior and access controls. Regular penetration tests target data pipelines and inference endpoints. Static analysis, dependency scanning, and red‑team exercises provide ongoing assurance.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
With layered defenses, rigorous validation, and continuous monitoring, the AI subsystem can support enterprise‑grade operations while resisting real‑world threats.
