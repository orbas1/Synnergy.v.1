# Token Standards Security Assessment

## Overview
Token standards define common interfaces for assets. Ensuring these implementations adhere to specifications is critical for interoperability and preventing asset loss or duplication.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Non‑compliant implementations** missing required events or functions.
- **Arithmetic overflows** manipulating balances or supply.
- **Improper allowance handling** leading to double‑spend via race conditions.
- **Lack of pause or emergency controls** hindering response to incidents.
- **Upgradeable token contracts** being replaced with malicious versions.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Reference official standard tests and certification programs before deployment.
- Use safe math libraries and extensive unit tests for balance operations.
- Implement checks for allowance changes and adopt pull‑based transfer patterns.
- Include emergency stop mechanisms governed by transparent procedures.
- Secure upgrade paths with multi‑sig governance and time delays.

## Security Testing
Interoperability test suites verify compliance with token standards. Formal verification, fuzzing, and third‑party audits assess token logic and upgrade mechanisms.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Adhering strictly to established standards and rigorous testing protects token holders and ecosystem integrations in real‑world use.
