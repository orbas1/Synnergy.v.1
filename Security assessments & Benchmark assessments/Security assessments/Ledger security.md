# Ledger Security Assessment

## Overview
The ledger is the authoritative record of all transactions and states. Its accuracy and immutability underpin the trust model of the Synnergy Network.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Data corruption or loss** due to hardware failure or malicious alteration.
- **Unauthorized ledger rewrites** from compromised nodes.
- **Inconsistent state replication** across nodes causing forks.
- **Exposure of sensitive metadata** allowing transaction deanonymization.
- **Insufficient backup procedures** leading to prolonged outages.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Employ redundant storage with integrity checks and periodic snapshots.
- Require consensus signatures for state changes and monitor for unauthorized rewrites.
- Use deterministic replication protocols and state validation to maintain consistency.
- Obfuscate or aggregate metadata to limit transactional surveillance.
- Maintain off‑site, encrypted backups with regular restoration drills.

## Security Testing
Disaster‑recovery exercises validate backup integrity and restoration speed. Chaos testing and consistency checks verify ledger replication. Monitoring systems alert on unexpected state divergences.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
With strong integrity controls and recovery planning, the ledger remains a trustworthy and resilient record for enterprise operations.
