# Storage Security Assessment

## Overview
Storage components retain blockchain state, user data, and backups. Securing storage ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Unauthorized data access** due to weak access controls or credential leaks.
- **Unencrypted data at rest** exposing sensitive information.
- **Ransomware or deletion attacks** targeting storage volumes.
- **Improper lifecycle management** leaving stale sensitive data.
- **Performance degradation** causing timeouts and potential data corruption.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce strict IAM policies and rotate credentials regularly.
- Encrypt data at rest with strong keys and manage them through HSMs.
- Maintain offline backups and implement immutable storage tiers to counter ransomware.
- Define retention schedules and secure deletion procedures.
- Monitor performance metrics and provision redundancy for high availability.

## Security Testing
Regular access audits verify permissions. Backup restoration tests, vulnerability scans, and integrity checks ensure stored data remains consistent and recoverable.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Robust encryption, governance, and monitoring keep storage systems reliable and resilient for enterprise workloads.
