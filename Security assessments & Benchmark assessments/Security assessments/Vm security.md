# Virtual Machine Security Assessment

## Overview
The virtual machine executes smart‑contract bytecode. Its isolation and correctness are vital to prevent contract interference, data leakage, or node compromise.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Sandbox escapes** allowing contracts to access host resources.
- **Memory safety bugs** leading to corruption or code execution.
- **Non‑deterministic behavior** causing consensus divergence.
- **Side‑channel leaks** via timing or resource usage differences.
- **Insufficient resource limits** enabling denial‑of‑service loops.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce strict sandboxing and system call filtering for VM processes.
- Use memory‑safe languages or rigorous audits for VM implementations.
- Design deterministic instruction sets and verify outputs across nodes.
- Apply constant‑time operations and isolate shared resources.
- Cap execution time, memory, and stack depth for each contract invocation.

## Security Testing
Extensive fuzzing and formal verification validate VM correctness. Differential testing across implementations detects divergence, while penetration tests attempt to break out of the sandbox.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Robust isolation and continual verification ensure the virtual machine executes untrusted code securely at enterprise scale.
