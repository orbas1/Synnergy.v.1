# Network Security Assessment

## Overview
The network layer enables peer communication and data propagation. Resilient networking is vital to prevent isolation, eavesdropping, or disruption of node operations.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Distributed denial‑of‑service attacks** saturating bandwidth or connection limits.
- **BGP or routing hijacks** redirecting traffic to malicious intermediaries.
- **Man‑in‑the‑middle attacks** intercepting or altering peer communications.
- **Unencrypted channels** revealing transaction content and metadata.
- **Insufficient peer authentication** allowing rogue node injection.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Deploy DDoS mitigation appliances and rate limiting at network edges.
- Use secure routing policies and monitor for prefix anomalies.
- Establish end‑to‑end encryption and mutual TLS for node communication.
- Support transaction broadcasting over privacy networks such as Tor or VPNs.
- Implement peer reputation systems and signed node identities.

## Security Testing
Network penetration tests simulate volumetric attacks and interception attempts. Continuous monitoring tracks latency, routing changes, and certificate validity. Red‑team exercises validate detection and response procedures.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Hardened networking and vigilant monitoring keep the peer‑to‑peer layer resilient against sophisticated adversaries.
