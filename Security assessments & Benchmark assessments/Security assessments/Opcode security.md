# Opcode Security Assessment

## Overview
Opcodes define the low‑level instructions executed by the virtual machine. Incorrect or malicious opcodes can compromise contract execution, data integrity, or node stability.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Undocumented or experimental opcodes** enabling unintended behaviors.
- **Arithmetic precision errors** causing overflows or underflows.
- **Inadequate gas accounting** permitting infinite loops or resource abuse.
- **Memory corruption** from out‑of‑bounds access.
- **Backward compatibility issues** introducing consensus splits during upgrades.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain a formal specification and require community review for new opcodes.
- Use constant‑time, checked arithmetic primitives within the VM.
- Benchmark and update gas costs, rejecting operations exceeding limits.
- Validate memory operations and implement sandboxing to isolate execution.
- Introduce opcode changes through versioned hard forks with extensive testing.

## Security Testing
Fuzz testing targets opcode implementations for edge cases and memory safety. Differential testing compares VM outputs across versions to detect regressions. External audits review critical opcode logic before release.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
A disciplined opcode lifecycle and comprehensive testing preserve VM reliability and protect smart‑contract execution in enterprise deployments.
