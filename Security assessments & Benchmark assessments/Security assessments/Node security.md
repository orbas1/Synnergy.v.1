# Node Security Assessment

## Overview
Individual nodes execute protocol logic, store state, and relay transactions. Compromise of a node can lead to data leakage, propagation of invalid data, or participation in attacks.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Remote code execution** via exposed RPC or management interfaces.
- **Insecure default configurations** leaving services unnecessarily open.
- **Malware or unauthorized software** running on host systems.
- **Resource exhaustion** causing node crashes or slowdowns.
- **Lack of monitoring** leading to undetected compromise.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Harden operating systems, close unused ports, and secure RPC with authentication.
- Provide hardened configuration templates and enforce configuration management.
- Utilize application whitelisting and regular malware scanning.
- Implement resource quotas and watchdog processes to restart unhealthy services.
- Deploy centralized monitoring, log aggregation, and alerting for anomalous behavior.

## Security Testing
Hostâ€‘based vulnerability scans and configuration audits run regularly. Incident response drills and penetration tests evaluate detection and containment capabilities.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Proactive hardening and operational vigilance keep individual nodes reliable and resistant to compromise in production environments.
