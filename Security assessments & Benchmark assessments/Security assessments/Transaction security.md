# Transaction Security Assessment

## Overview
Transactions represent state changes and value transfers. Ensuring their authenticity and resistance to manipulation is fundamental to the network’s trust model.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Replay attacks** resubmitting transactions on the same or different chains.
- **Transaction malleability** altering signatures without changing effect.
- **Front‑running** exploiting visibility in mempools.
- **Insufficient input validation** causing malformed or fraudulent transactions.
- **Privacy leakage** through transaction graph analysis.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Incorporate nonces and chain identifiers to prevent replays.
- Use canonical serialization and signature schemes resistant to malleability.
- Introduce commit‑reveal schemes or private mempools to mitigate front‑running.
- Validate all transaction fields and reject malformed data early.
- Support mixers, ring signatures, or zero‑knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy.

## Security Testing
Unit and integration tests cover serialization, signature validation, and nonce handling. Penetration tests and mempool analytics evaluate front‑running protections and privacy features.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Rigorous validation and privacy‑preserving features ensure transactions remain trustworthy and secure in production environments.
