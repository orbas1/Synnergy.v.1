# Compliance Module Security Assessment

## Overview
The compliance module enforces regulatory requirements such as KYC, AML, and reporting obligations. It interfaces with external authorities and handles sensitive identity data, making accuracy and privacy crucial.

## Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Unauthorized modification** of compliance rules or whitelist/blacklist entries.
- **Leakage of personally identifiable information** through insecure storage or APIs.
- **Insufficient audit logging** hampering investigations and legal proof.
- **Integration failures** with external regulators leading to missed filings.
- **Privilege misuse** by compliance officers or automated agents.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Restrict rule changes to multiâ€‘party approvals and track all modifications.
- Store identity data encrypted with strict access controls and retention policies.
- Centralize logging with immutable storage and regular compliance audits.
- Validate external integrations and implement retry/alert mechanisms for failures.
- Enforce least privilege and session monitoring for all compliance tooling.

## Security Testing
Automated tests validate policy enforcement and data access paths. Periodic audits simulate regulator interactions, while penetration tests focus on API endpoints and data stores handling PII.
Automated validation on 2025-09-11 verified 5 vulnerabilities and 5 mitigations.

## Conclusion
Proper controls and auditing enable the compliance module to meet legal obligations while protecting user data in a production environment.
