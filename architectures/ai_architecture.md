- ai.go
- ai_drift_monitor.go
- ai_enhanced_contract.go
- ai_inference_analysis.go
- ai_model_management.go
- ai_secure_storage.go
- ai_training.go
- anomaly_detection.go

**Related CLI Files**
- cli/ai_contract.go

These modules integrate machine learning features with contract execution and monitoring services.
