# Wallet Architecture

Stage 31 introduces a thin wallet layer that leverages the existing CLI and
`walletserver` backend. Keys are generated locally within the CLI and can be
exported as encrypted JSON files. The GUI wallet invokes CLI commands via a
restricted interface to ensure private keys never leave the host machine.

The wallet uses scrypt key derivation and AESâ€‘GCM encryption to protect private
keys at rest. All operations emit JSON for deterministic parsing in user
interfaces and automated agents.
