# Development Stages and File Index

## Stages 1-136 – File Upgrade Checklist

### Progress
- Stage 18: Complete – mining-staking-manager env, build and CI scaffolding finalized.
- Stage 67: Complete – ledger, light node, and liquidity pool validation with Kademlia gas tracking and CLI distance tests, plus identity service and wallet registry checks finalized.
- Stage 68: Complete – mining node context control, fee distribution, and CLI mine-until integration finalized with gas pricing and opcode docs extended.
- Stage 69: Complete – node and plasma modules hardened with concurrency-safe mempools, pause checks, opcode lookup tests and peer count CLI.
- Stage 73: Complete – enterprise index, grant, benefit, charity, legal and utility modules now require wallet-signed workflows, persist their state for CLI/web automation, expose telemetry across CLI, VM and web, and refreshed docs/guides capture the expanded gas/opcode catalogue.
- Stage 74: In progress – system health logging clamped; tangible and agricultural asset registries made concurrency safe; access controller audit snapshots added. Transaction and SYN5000+ modules outstanding.
- Stage 75: Complete – warfare/watchtower/zero-trust modules emit signed events with CLI/UI integration, deterministic CLI metadata handling and hardened subscription tests.
- Stage 136: Pending – security assessment and benchmark scaffolds reserved for final stage.
