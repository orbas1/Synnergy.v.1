# Blockchain Fees and Gas – Stage 77 Governance

Stage 77 introduces automated gas validation, runtime integration and deployment
patterns that keep Synnergy’s fee economics consistent across documentation,
smart contracts, CLI automation and enterprise tooling.

## Gas Table Governance

- The authoritative gas catalogue is maintained in `docs/reference/gas_table_list.md`
  and loaded at runtime by `LoadGasTable`, providing deterministic pricing for
  consensus, cross-chain, AI, storage and governance operations【F:gas_table.go†L15-L87】.
- `EnsureGasCosts` verifies that critical opcodes used by the CLI, runtime
  integration and Next.js dashboard have documented prices, failing fast during
  startup or tests if entries drift【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L92-L125】.
- Runtime integration registers these prices with the in-memory gas cache before
  any CLI command executes, aligning manual operations, automation scripts and
  smart-contract execution with the documented fee schedule【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L92-L125】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L46-L99】.

## Virtual Machine Enforcement

- The virtual machine now tracks opcode names and consults the gas resolver on
  every instruction, applying per-opcode limits rather than coarse counts. This
  change guarantees that the gas charged during contract execution matches the
  published reference values and respects user-provided limits【F:virtual_machine.go†L24-L142】.
- Tests assert that missing gas entries trigger explicit errors, preventing
  undocumented fees from slipping into the runtime or documentation【F:gas_table_test.go†L1-L42】.

## Deployment Integration

- Docker images expose health checks and configuration mounts that surface gas
  configuration and allow overrides via environment variables or mounted files,
  keeping local development and production clusters aligned【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】.
- Kubernetes manifests include ConfigMaps for runtime configuration and
  OpenTelemetry collectors so gas consumption and fee distributions can be
  monitored via dashboards and alerts【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】.
- Terraform provisions SSM parameters and IAM policies to deliver encrypted gas
  configuration to autoscaling groups, ensuring immutable infrastructure uses the
  same fee settings as the CLI and documentation【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L231】.

## Accessibility and Transparency

- The JavaScript function web consumes the CLI’s RPC endpoints, presenting gas
  tables, fee forecasts and transaction previews to non-technical stakeholders
  without bypassing the canonical runtime【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.
- Documentation updates in Stage 77, including the module boundaries and
  production stages, record the new governance process so contributors and
  auditors understand how gas changes propagate through code, tests and
  infrastructure【F:docs/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md†L1-L30】【F:docs/PRODUCTION_STAGES.md†L145-L159】.

These enhancements keep Synnergy’s gas model predictable, auditable and aligned
across development, operations and governance channels.
