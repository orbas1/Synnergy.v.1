# How to Create Our Various Tokens

Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to support a wide spectrum of tokenised assets, each governed by dedicated registries and ledgers. This guide explains how to instantiate and manage these tokens using the Synnergy libraries and tooling.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Install the Synnergy toolchain** – build the `synnergy` CLI and ensure Go 1.20+ is available.
2. **Set up auxiliary tools** – the `token-creation-tool` GUI scaffolds new token projects and is located under `GUI/token-creation-tool`【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/developer_guide.md†L321-L332】【F:GUI/token-creation-tool/README.md†L1-L23】.
3. **Select the appropriate node role** – some token standards are limited to authority or central bank nodes as described in the developer guide【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/developer_guide.md†L212-L230】.

## 2. General Workflow

1. **Choose a token standard** – review the token categories below and select the structure that matches the asset or utility you need.
2. **Instantiate the registry or ledger** – each token exposes a constructor (e.g., `NewSYN500Token`) to create an in-memory registry.
3. **Populate metadata and balances** – register assets, mint supply, or configure governance depending on the token type.
4. **Compile and deploy** – integrate the token logic into smart contracts or services, then deploy via `synnergy` CLI or the GUI tool.
5. **Maintain lifecycle** – use provided methods for transfers, updates, and audits to keep on-chain data consistent.

## 3. Token Standards

### 3.0 Token Structure Overview
Every Synnergy token embeds the concurrency‑safe `BaseToken` type, which offers ERC‑style balances, allowances and transfer routines guarded by RWMutex locks for safe parallel execution【F:internal/tokens/base.go†L11-L47】【F:internal/tokens/base.go†L60-L112】. Registries and indices wrap `BaseToken` instances in mutex‑protected maps so enterprise deployments can mint, transfer and audit tokens across many goroutines without race conditions【F:internal/tokens/syn200.go†L31-L59】【F:internal/tokens/syn1000_index.go†L9-L27】. This layered structure lets higher‑level standards extend base behaviour with domain‑specific metadata while preserving deterministic accounting.

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Version control** every token contract or registry definition.
2. **Write tests** for registry operations and permission checks before deployment.
3. **Monitor events** emitted by registries to maintain off-chain mirrors of on-chain state.
4. **Use the provided tooling** for consistent builds and to integrate with Blackridge Group’s deployment pipelines.

## 7. Conclusion

By selecting the appropriate standard and leveraging Synnergy’s registries, developers can model everything from simple utility passes to complex asset-backed instruments. Blackridge Group Ltd. provides both CLI and GUI tooling to streamline token creation while maintaining regulatory and operational rigor.
