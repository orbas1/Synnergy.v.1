# Cross-Chain Architecture

## Overview
Cross-chain components allow the Synnergy Network to interoperate with external blockchains. Bridges, connection managers and protocol adapters move assets and data while preserving deterministic execution.

## Key Modules
- `cross_chain_bridge.go` – coordinates locked assets and releases across chains.
- `cross_chain_connection.go` – maintains authenticated links to foreign networks.
- `cross_chain_contracts.go` – wraps remote contract calls with verification steps.
- `cross_chain_transactions.go` – queues and relays transactions between networks.
- `cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go` – standardizes message formats for different chains.

## Workflow
1. **Connection setup** – `cross_chain_connection` establishes authenticated channels to target networks.
2. **Asset locking** – `cross_chain_bridge` escrows tokens and emits proofs of lock.
3. **Relay** – authorized relayers submit proofs to the destination chain where assets are minted or released.
4. **Contract execution** – `cross_chain_contracts` verify the proof and invoke remote logic.
5. **Finalization** – `cross_chain_transactions` record the result and update local ledgers.

## Security Considerations
- Relayers are whitelisted and their actions logged to prevent spoofed messages.
- Bridges verify proofs using light-client techniques and reject malformed data.
- Rate limits and size checks protect against flooding the relay queues.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy cross-chain` – manage bridge operations and relay status.
- `synnergy cross-chain-connection` – configure endpoints and authorizations.
- `synnergy cross-chain-bridge` – lock, release and verify assets.
