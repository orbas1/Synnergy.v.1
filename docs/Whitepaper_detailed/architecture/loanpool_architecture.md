# Loanpool Architecture

## Overview
Loanpool modules administer community lending pools that issue grants or loans to participants. Authority nodes review applications and the smart contract enforces repayment terms.

## Key Modules
- `cli/loanpool.go` – high level operations for creating and funding pools.
- `cli/loanpool_apply.go` – submit loan or grant applications.
- `cmd/scripts/loanpool_apply.sh` – example script for automating submissions.
- `core` loanpool routines integrated via opcodes for contract execution.

## Workflow
1. **Pool creation** – authority nodes initialize pools and set parameters.
2. **Application** – users apply through `loanpool_apply` specifying amount and purpose.
3. **Review** – authority nodes evaluate applications and approve or reject.
4. **Disbursement** – approved loans are released through on-chain transactions.
5. **Repayment tracking** – the contract monitors payments and can trigger penalties for defaults.

## Security Considerations
- Authority node actions are logged and require multi-signature approval.
- Applications are validated to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Loan terms are immutable once the contract is deployed.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy loanpool` – create pools and manage funding.
- `synnergy loanpool-apply` – submit or review applications.

## Enterprise Diagnostics
- Diagnostic runs credit the integration wallet before mining a block, validating that ledger minting and fee accounting—prerequisites for loan disbursements—remain functional.
- Operators can compare CLI output with loanpool dashboards to ensure credit availability and authority quorum are aligned.
