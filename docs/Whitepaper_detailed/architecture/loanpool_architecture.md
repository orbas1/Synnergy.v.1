# Loanpool Architecture

Loanpool modules manage on-chain lending pools, proposals, and applications. They coordinate borrower interactions and pool governance.

**Key Modules**
- core/loanpool.go

- core/loanpool_proposal.go
- core/loanpool_views.go

**Related CLI Files**
- cli/loanpool.go

Together these files implement lending pools, including application processing, proposal voting, and management tools.
