# Security Architecture

## Overview
Security modules protect the network from malicious actors and data leakage. Layers range from firewalls and anomaly detection to private transactions and zero‑trust data channels.

## Key Modules
- `firewall.go` – filters inbound and outbound traffic based on configurable rules.
- `anomaly_detection.go` – analyses behaviour to detect attacks or protocol violations.
- `private_transactions.go` – obfuscates transaction details for confidential transfers.
- `zero_trust_data_channels.go` – encrypts inter-node communication with rotating keys.
- `biometric_security_node.go` – handles biometric verification for high-security environments.

## Workflow
1. **Traffic filtering** – `firewall` evaluates connection attempts before peers are admitted.
2. **Runtime monitoring** – `anomaly_detection` inspects logs and metrics for irregularities.
3. **Secure communication** – nodes exchange data through `zero_trust_data_channels` ensuring end-to-end encryption.
4. **Confidential execution** – `private_transactions` process sensitive transfers with limited disclosure.

## Security Considerations
- Firewall rules and anomaly thresholds are versioned and auditable.
- Zero-trust channels rotate keys to limit exposure from compromised peers.
- Private transaction modules enforce gas limits to mitigate spam.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy firewall` – manage firewall rules.
- `synnergy private-tx` – create and inspect private transactions.
- `synnergy anomaly` – review detected anomalies.
