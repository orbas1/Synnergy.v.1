# AI Architecture

## Overview
The AI subsystem enables smart contracts and nodes to incorporate machine learning capabilities. It covers model training, secure storage, on-chain inference and ongoing drift detection so deployed models remain trustworthy.

## Key Modules
- `ai_training.go` – orchestrates offline model training and records checksums.
- `ai_model_management.go` – tracks registered models and owners.
- `ai_enhanced_contract.go` – wraps WebAssembly models for deterministic contract calls.
- `ai_inference_analysis.go` – executes inference requests and returns results to the VM.
- `ai_secure_storage.go` – encrypts model artifacts and wipes them after execution.
- `ai_drift_monitor.go` – compares live predictions against baselines to flag drift.

## Workflow
1. **Train** models off-chain and register the hash through `ai_training`.
2. **Store** artifacts using `ai_secure_storage` so only authorized nodes can access them.
3. **Deploy** via `synnergy ai_contract deploy` which binds the model hash to a contract.
4. **Infer** when transactions invoke the contract; `ai_inference_analysis` loads the model and meters gas.
5. **Monitor** using `ai_drift_monitor` which triggers alerts or retraining when accuracy degrades.

## Security Considerations
- Model files remain encrypted at rest and are scrubbed from disk after use.
- All inference requests are gas metered and validated to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Drift and anomaly events can route to the broader anomaly detection system for investigation.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy ai_contract` – deploy, invoke and inspect AI‑enhanced contracts.
- `synnergy ai_model` – list registered models and associated hashes.
