# Specialized Features Architecture

## Overview
Certain modules provide niche or experimental capabilities that extend the core platform. These features target specialized industries or research use cases and are isolated from critical consensus paths.

## Example Modules
- `geospatial_node.go` – processes location-aware data for mapping or logistics applications.
- `environmental_monitoring_node.go` – records sensor data for sustainability tracking.
- `financial_prediction.go` – runs predictive models for market analysis.
- `holographic.go` – explores holographic data visualisation techniques.
- `energy_efficient_node.go` – optimizes mining for low-power hardware.

## Workflow
Specialized nodes register their capabilities and expose APIs relevant to their domain. Other services can query them for enriched data or analytics without impacting consensus throughput.

## Security Considerations
- These modules are optional and can be disabled in high-security deployments.
- Data produced by specialized nodes may require separate validation or calibration.
- Resource usage is monitored to ensure experimental features do not exhaust network capacity.

## CLI Integration
Relevant features expose dedicated CLI commands such as `synnergy geospatial-node` or `synnergy energy-node` depending on the module.
