# Monitoring and Logging Architecture

## Overview
Observability components provide operators with insight into node health and network conditions. Logging utilities stream structured events while watchtower nodes monitor peers for outages or malicious behaviour.

## Key Modules
- `system_health_logging.go` – emits metrics and health events.
- `watchtower_node.go` – monitors peer availability and reports anomalies.
- `anomaly_detection.go` – analyses logs for suspicious patterns.

## Workflow
1. **Event capture** – nodes call `system_health_logging` to record resource usage and errors.
2. **Watchtower aggregation** – `watchtower_node` collects peer heartbeats and cross-checks logs.
3. **Alerting** – anomalies trigger alerts or automated responses such as node isolation.

## Security Considerations
- Logs omit sensitive data and can be encrypted when transported.
- Watchtower queries use authenticated channels to prevent spoofing.
- Rate limiting ensures logging cannot be used to exhaust disk space.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy watchtower` – manage watchtower nodes.
- `synnergy logs` – stream or filter system logs (via `system_health_logging`).

## Enterprise Diagnostics
- Integration status runs append a consolidated diagnostics map that monitoring stacks can ingest to detect regressions across VM, consensus and authority subsystems.
- Because the probe only uses ephemeral state, it can be scheduled alongside watchtower sweeps without polluting operational log stores.
