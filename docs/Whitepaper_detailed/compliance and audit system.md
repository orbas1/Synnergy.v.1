# Compliance and Audit System

**Blackridge Group Ltd.** delivers an enterprise-grade compliance and auditing framework for the Synnergy Network. The system blends deterministic virtual machine execution with granular policy controls to ensure regulatory adherence, transparent operations and forensic-grade logging across every component.

## 1. Core Compliance Service
The `ComplianceService` orchestrates know-your-customer (KYC) data, fraud signals and risk scores while maintaining immutable audit trails. Internally it employs thread-safe maps and structured logging so validators can scale without race conditions:

- **KYC validation and erasure** – hashes incoming documents, stores commitments and supports secure removal while emitting structured logs【F:core/compliance.go†L55-L78】
- **Fraud detection and risk scoring** – appends severity-weighted signals, updates cumulative risk and records metadata-rich audit entries【F:core/compliance.go†L80-L90】
- **Audit trail retrieval** – returns copies of per-address event histories for investigators, preserving the original records from mutation【F:core/compliance.go†L101-L108】
- **Transaction anomaly monitoring** – tracks transaction IDs, flags threshold breaches and logs anomalies for post‑mortem analysis【F:core/compliance.go†L111-L124】
- **Zero‑knowledge proof verification** – verifies commitments without disclosing underlying data, preserving confidentiality during compliance checks【F:core/compliance.go†L127-L132】

## 2. Identity Verification Framework
A dedicated `IdentityService` records verified identity metadata and verification attempts, enabling enterprises to associate KYC artifacts with on-chain accounts:

- Stores name, date of birth and nationality for registered addresses and rejects duplicates【F:identity_verification.go†L37-L45】
- Records every verification method with timestamped logs for auditing provenance of identity checks【F:identity_verification.go†L48-L56】
- Exposes read‑only APIs for retrieving identity records and verification histories【F:identity_verification.go†L60-L75】

## 3. Role‑Based Access Control
Internal services employ an RBAC layer to gate privileged actions and capture authorization attempts:

- `RBAC` maintains roles, permissions and user assignments using concurrent maps【F:internal/auth/rbac.go†L8-L66】
- `PolicyEnforcer` checks permissions and records JSON‑formatted audit entries through an injectable `AuditLogger`【F:internal/auth/rbac.go†L88-L109】【F:internal/auth/audit.go†L10-L39】

## 4. Address Control and Whitelisting
The `ComplianceManager` enforces policy actions on addresses:

- Suspend or resume transfers for flagged entities
- Maintain whitelists to override suspensions for approved addresses
- Review outbound transactions before broadcast, blocking those involving suspended parties

These functions operate through mutex‑protected maps and transaction review logic, enabling rapid policy updates without network downtime【F:compliance_management.go†L30-L78】.

## 5. Regulatory Enforcement Layer
To accommodate jurisdictional rules, Blackridge Group Ltd. provides a modular regulatory suite:

- `RegulatoryManager` stores regulations with identifiers, jurisdictions and maximum transaction thresholds, returning all violations for a proposed transfer【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】
- `RegulatoryNode` uses the manager to approve or reject transactions and records reasons in per-address logs for auditors【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L49】

This separation of policy definition and enforcement allows different regions to apply bespoke rules while preserving a unified network codebase.

## 6. Audit Infrastructure
Network integrity is monitored by dedicated audit components:

- `AuditManager` records timestamped events and retrieves histories in a tamper‑evident manner【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L60】
- `AuditNode` couples a bootstrap node with the manager, exposing start, log and list operations for compliance teams【F:core/audit_node.go†L5-L49】
- `StdAuditLogger` writes JSON‑formatted authorization logs for forensic analysis and external SIEM ingestion【F:internal/auth/audit.go†L10-L39】

## 7. Streaming Anomaly Detection
A lightweight `AnomalyDetector` provides statistical outlier detection for streaming metrics and transaction amounts. Using Welford’s method for incremental mean and variance, it flags values exceeding configurable z‑score thresholds without storing raw histories【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## 8. Deterministic Opcode and Gas Accounting
The Synnergy Virtual Machine assigns fixed opcodes to all compliance, identity and audit functions, ensuring deterministic execution paths. Complementary gas table entries price each operation so wallets can display fee impacts:

- Opcodes cover compliance managers, KYC validation, audit logging, identity services and RBAC checks【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L37-L149】
- Gas table documentation explicitly prices reward, supply and KYC operations to make policy enforcement economically transparent【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】

## 9. Command‑Line Ecosystem
Administrators interact with the framework through structured CLI tools:

- `synnergy compliance` – validate KYC, erase records, record fraud, assess risk, view audit trails, monitor transactions and verify ZKPs【F:cli/compliance.go†L30-L166】
- `synnergy compliance_management` – suspend, resume, whitelist, unwhitelist and review transactions at the address level【F:cli/compliance_mgmt.go†L28-L85】
- `synnergy regulator` and `synnergy regnode` – manage regulations, approve transactions and inspect regulatory logs【F:cli/regulatory_management.go†L12-L53】【F:cli/regulatory_node.go†L12-L33】
- `synnergy audit` and `synnergy audit_node` – append and retrieve audit events locally or via a bootstrap‑aware audit node【F:cli/audit.go†L14-L65】【F:cli/audit_node.go†L21-L80】
- `synnergy identity` – register identity metadata, record verification methods and inspect associated logs【F:cli/identity.go†L12-L59】

## 10. Automation and Tooling
Shell utilities streamline common workflows:

- `compliance_setup.sh` provisions initial KYC commitments via the CLI【F:scripts/compliance_setup.sh†L1-L12】
- `compliance_audit.sh` and `compliance_rule_update.sh` reserve hooks for policy audits and ruleset migrations, providing a template for production automation【F:scripts/compliance_audit.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/compliance_rule_update.sh†L1-L17】

## 11. Monitoring Dashboards
An enterprise-grade React/TypeScript dashboard visualises compliance metrics and integrates linting, testing and containerised deployment for operational teams【F:GUI/compliance-dashboard/README.md†L1-L30】.

## 12. End‑to‑End Workflow Example
1. **Provision KYC:** run `compliance_setup.sh mykyc.json` to hash and store commitments.
2. **Suspend Malicious Actor:** invoke `synnergy compliance_management suspend badaddr` and optionally whitelist exceptions.
3. **Enforce Regulation:** define a rule via `synnergy regulator add AML1 US "AML Threshold" 1000` and let `synnergy regnode approve` gate outbound transfers.
4. **Log and Review:** auditors execute `synnergy audit log addr event key=value` and export histories for oversight.
5. **Identity Assurance:** regulatory officers query `synnergy identity info addr` to validate the subject of investigation.

## 13. Security and Forensics
Immutable audit trails, granular address controls and deterministic opcodes enable real‑time monitoring and post‑incident reconstruction. JSON logging aligns with external SIEM pipelines, while zero‑knowledge verification and RBAC auditing preserve confidentiality without compromising oversight.

## 14. Zero‑Trust Data Channels
`ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted channels anchored by ephemeral Ed25519 keys to isolate sensitive payloads. Messages are symmetrically encrypted, signed, stored and later verified before decryption, allowing investigators to prove integrity without exposing plaintext【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L102】.

## 15. Watchtower Monitoring and Health Logging
`WatchtowerNode` pairs a node‑level firewall with continuous health sampling to surface forks and resource anomalies. Metrics collected include goroutine counts, memory usage, peer totals and last block height, all emitted on a ten‑second cadence for operational dashboards【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L68】【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L40】. Dedicated opcodes bind these monitoring routines to deterministic VM execution【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L44-L75】.

## 16. Transaction Governance and Reversals
Advanced transaction controls enable deferred execution, cancellation and authority‑mediated reversals. Scheduled transactions can be cancelled before execution, while reversal requests freeze funds and require a quorum of authority votes before compensation is applied【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L106】.

## 17. Private Transactions and Receipts
AES‑GCM wrappers convert transactions into encrypted payloads and later decrypt them for authorized parties. Every processed transaction generates a searchable receipt, supporting audit queries across status, identifier or free‑form metadata【F:core/transaction_control.go†L116-L210】.

## 18. Firewall Enforcement
A lightweight `Firewall` maintains concurrent blocklists for addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs. Rules can be added or removed at runtime, giving compliance teams immediate network‑level quarantine capabilities that integrate with watchtower nodes and policy engines【F:firewall.go†L5-L88】.
