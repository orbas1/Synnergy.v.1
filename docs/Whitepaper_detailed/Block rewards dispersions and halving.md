# Block Rewards, Distribution and Halving – Stage 77 Economics

Stage 77 refines Synnergy’s reward mechanics by aligning consensus, wallet,
ledger and documentation components through the runtime integration and
deployment pipelines.

## Reward Calculation

- Blocks distribute transaction fees and block rewards using helper contracts
  that reference validator stakes, block utilisation and consensus weights to
  maintain predictable economics across PoW, PoS and PoH participants【F:core/node.go†L81-L160】【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L218】.
- `NewRuntimeIntegration` pre-registers gas costs and stakes the operator wallet
  before CLI commands execute, ensuring mining, staking and halving operations
  observe the same pricing and validator set as production deployments【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L15-L126】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L38-L99】.
- Gas schedule enforcement guarantees that economic operations such as
  `BlockReward`, `CirculatingSupply` and `RemainingSupply` are priced according to
  the published reference tables, preventing unbounded reward queries or wallet
  manipulation【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L62-L90】.

## Distribution Pipelines

- Reward shares are credited via the ledger and fee distribution contracts,
  applying validator penalties or bonuses based on quorum participation and block
  performance metrics【F:core/node.go†L125-L160】【F:core/stake_penalty.go†L8-L61】.
- Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform deployments store configuration in encrypted
  volumes and parameters so that halving schedules, minimum stake thresholds and
  treasury addresses remain consistent across environments【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L231】.
- The Next.js function web consumes the same RPC interfaces as the CLI, exposing
  dashboards for reward distribution, validator performance and halving countdowns
  without bespoke backend services【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.

## Testing and Governance

- Integration tests sign and submit transactions via the runtime integration,
  verifying ledger updates and health telemetry to ensure halving or reward
  changes do not break CLI automation or orchestration tooling【F:integration_test.go†L5-L66】.
- Governance controls enforced by authority nodes and the regulatory manager
  validate reward adjustments, block reversals or treasury reallocations, keeping
  economic policy auditable and permissioned【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L1-L35】【F:core/regulatory_node.go†L17-L90】.

Stage 77 couples deterministic gas schedules, runtime orchestration and
infrastructure automation to deliver a reward system that is transparent,
scalable and compliant across all Synnergy deployment models.
