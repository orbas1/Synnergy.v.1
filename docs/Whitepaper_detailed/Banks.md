# Banking Nodes – Stage 77 Enterprise Capabilities

Banking nodes extend Synnergy into regulated financial ecosystems. Stage 77
synchronises banking workflows with the runtime integration, providing
cryptographic assurance, governance alignment and operational resilience from
CLI to production clusters.

## Institutional Onboarding and Compliance

- Bank nodes embed compliance monitors that pause transactions failing know-your-
  customer (KYC) or anti-money-laundering (AML) checks, exposing results via
  auditable logs and CLI commands【F:core/bank_institutional_node.go†L1-L60】【F:cli/bank_institutional_node.go†L1-L140】.
- The runtime integration registers banking wallets with the regulatory node so
  every transfer, loan issuance or collateral adjustment carries a digital
  signature validated against stored public keys before consensus approval,
  ensuring legal accountability【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L39-L126】.
- Kubernetes and Docker manifests include secrets management, network policies
  and health checks to protect banking credentials when deployed in hybrid or
  multi-cloud environments【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】.

## Liquidity, Fees and Gas Transparency

- Banking operations rely on the expanded gas catalogue enforced by
  `EnsureGasCosts`, guaranteeing that fee schedules for lending, staking,
  collateralisation and settlement remain synchronised across documentation,
  CLI outputs and smart-contract execution【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Blockchain Fees & Gas.md†L1-L80】.
- Terraform provisions load-balanced node fleets and encrypted databases to store
  loan books and audit trails, distributing traffic across availability zones for
  high transaction throughput while respecting regulatory record-keeping
  obligations【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L73-L231】.
- The Docker Compose stack exposes REST endpoints consumed by the Next.js web
  client, allowing treasury teams to view gas forecasts, execute CLI commands and
  monitor wallet approvals through a unified interface【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.

## Interoperability and Cross-Chain Services

- Banking nodes leverage cross-chain opcodes to bridge assets, settle payments
  and monitor liquidity across partner blockchains, benefiting from the runtime
  integration’s gas enforcement to keep costs predictable and auditable【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L200-L320】【F:virtual_machine.go†L24-L142】.
- Consensus integration ensures banking-specific validators participate in
  adaptive weighting and fault-tolerant switching, maintaining performance during
  surges in payment volume or regulatory reporting cycles【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L15-L192】【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L128】.

## Testing and Operational Insight

- Runtime integration tests cover transaction signing, submission and health
  telemetry, giving banking operators confidence that CLI automation mirrors
  production-grade deployments【F:integration_test.go†L5-L66】.
- Health data streamed through the runtime integration is logged by the CLI and
  surfaced in Kubernetes readiness probes, enabling real-time monitoring of block
  production, validator status and wallet connectivity without bespoke scripts【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L133-L192】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L109-L125】.

Stage 77 delivers a banking node framework that satisfies compliance, security
and scalability requirements demanded by institutional partners while retaining
Synnergy’s hybrid consensus performance and cross-chain reach.
