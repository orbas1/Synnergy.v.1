# Artificial Intelligence Platform – Stage 77 Update

The Synnergy AI stack now operates as a first-class citizen within the enterprise
runtime. The runtime integrator introduced in Stage 77 ensures that the AI model
marketplace, inference services and training pipelines all share the same
consensus, wallet and gas configuration used by the CLI and the JavaScript
function web. Key capabilities include:

## Secure Model Lifecycle

- **Marketplace Contracts** – AI models are listed, purchased and invoked via
  deterministic opcodes enumerated in `SNVMOpcodes`, allowing on-chain
  coordination for publishing, pricing, escrow and analytics【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L1-L120】.
- **Governed Execution** – The Stage 77 runtime ensures every opcode executed by
  the virtual machine is priced using the documented gas catalogue, preventing
  runaway computation during inference or training jobs【F:virtual_machine.go†L24-L142】【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】.
- **Wallet Binding** – Operator wallets created by `NewRuntimeIntegration`
  register their public keys with the regulatory node, so AI workloads inherit
  auditable approvals and tamper-evident signatures before entering the training
  queue or deploying models to production【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L39-L192】.

## Privacy and Compliance

- **Regulatory Oversight** – The runtime integration connects AI transactions to
  the regulatory node, flagging anomalous behaviour and enforcing jurisdictional
  policy through the same checks applied to financial transactions and smart
  contracts【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L43-L79】.
- **Permissioned Access** – Wallet server containers now ship with secrets and
  network policies that only admit authorised node traffic, protecting
  AI-generated insights and sensitive training data when accessed via the CLI or
  web dashboard【F:deploy/k8s/wallet.yaml†L1-L108】【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.
- **Auditability** – Terraform provisions an encrypted PostgreSQL instance for
  AI and wallet audit trails, keyed by AWS KMS to satisfy data residency and
  financial reporting requirements【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L197-L231】.

## Scalability and Interoperability

- **Auto-Scaling Infrastructure** – Kubernetes manifests now include horizontal
  pod autoscalers and PodDisruptionBudgets for both node and wallet workloads,
  delivering high availability as AI traffic grows while preserving validator
  quorum【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】【F:deploy/k8s/wallet.yaml†L1-L108】.
- **Multi-Channel Access** – Docker Compose bundles the node, wallet and Next.js
  function web, enabling AI administrators to trigger CLI commands, review gas
  consumption and monitor training jobs from a unified dashboard【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.
- **Cross-Chain Hooks** – Consensus and cross-chain opcodes remain accessible to
  AI contracts, allowing models to react to external chain events, bridge tokens
  or feed data into other blockchains without compromising deterministic
  execution【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L121-L200】.

## Testing and Assurance

- **Runtime Integration Tests** – New integration tests exercise the AI-enabled
  runtime by signing transactions, executing bytecode and verifying that health
  telemetry is emitted as expected, providing regression coverage for CLI,
  virtual machine and wallet interactions【F:integration_test.go†L5-L66】.
- **Gas Table Verification** – `EnsureGasCosts` fails fast when AI or ML opcodes
  lack documented gas entries, ensuring reference guides, CLI tooling and the VM
  never drift apart【F:gas_table_test.go†L1-L42】.
- **Documentation Synchronisation** – Stage 77 updates the AI whitepaper, module
  boundaries and production stages to reflect enterprise-ready integration across
  infrastructure, CLI and governance workflows【F:docs/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md†L1-L30】【F:docs/PRODUCTION_STAGES.md†L145-L159】.

Together these enhancements deliver a secure, scalable and compliant AI platform
that integrates seamlessly with Synnergy’s consensus engine, wallet services and
front-end tooling. AI stakeholders can now trust that gas costs, telemetry,
access control and regulatory requirements remain consistent across CLI,
Terraform, Kubernetes and the enterprise web interface.
