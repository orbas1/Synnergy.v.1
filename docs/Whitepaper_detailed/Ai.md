# Artificial Intelligence

## Strategic Vision
Neto Solaris embeds artificial intelligence at the core of the Synnergy Network to deliver predictive insight, autonomous optimisation and a self‑service model economy. The AI stack operates within a privacy‑preserving, decentralised environment while satisfying enterprise governance requirements.

## AI Service Layer
The `AIService` orchestrates prediction utilities and model commerce through concurrency‑safe registries backed by read‑write mutexes【F:ai.go†L32-L38】.
- **PredictFraud** ingests transaction payloads and derives a deterministic fraud probability by hashing the JSON bytes【F:ai.go†L50-L58】.
- **OptimiseBaseFee** reviews average gas prices to recommend the next block’s base fee【F:ai.go†L60-L67】.
- **ForecastVolume** scales recent transaction counts to project near‑term network activity【F:ai.go†L70-L77】.
Model metadata captures royalty percentages and publish timestamps so creators are compensated whenever analytics are invoked【F:ai.go†L13-L19】【F:ai.go†L80-L92】.

## Model Marketplace and Escrow
Enterprise participants monetise models through the `ModelMarketplace`, which tracks listings, owners and dynamic pricing with thread‑safe maps【F:ai_model_management.go†L19-L24】【F:ai_model_management.go†L31-L45】. Listings can be enumerated, updated or removed by the seller to reflect evolving commercial terms【F:ai_model_management.go†L56-L98】. Purchases deposit funds into an escrow ledger, while rentals set an expiry window before releasing payment; escrows are cleared atomically once the seller claims funds【F:ai.go†L108-L151】【F:ai.go†L153-L164】.

## Training Lifecycle Orchestration
The `TrainingManager` coordinates model development pipelines using guarded job registries【F:ai_training.go†L20-L24】. Operators can start jobs by providing dataset and model identifiers【F:ai_training.go†L32-L49】, query status or enumerate all jobs for auditability【F:ai_training.go†L52-L69】, and cancel or complete work while recording terminal timestamps for governance【F:ai_training.go†L71-L103】.

## Inference Engine and Fraud Analysis
The `InferenceEngine` loads model binaries and returns deterministic output hashes for reproducible decisioning【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L15-L43】. A batch `Analyse` method produces per‑transaction fraud scores, enabling automated compliance across large datasets【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L45-L53】.

## Continuous Monitoring
### Drift Monitoring
`DriftMonitor` maintains baseline metrics and reports deviations exceeding a configurable threshold to highlight model decay before it impacts production【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.
### Anomaly Detection
An `AnomalyDetector` performs streaming z‑score checks over operational signals, defaulting to a threshold of three standard deviations to minimise false positives【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Secure Model Storage
`SecureStorage` protects artefacts with AES‑GCM encryption. Keys must be 32 bytes, nonces are randomly generated and ciphertext is stored only after successful sealing, ensuring confidentiality and integrity on retrieval【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L23-L44】【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L47-L75】.

## AI‑Enhanced Smart Contracts
The `AIContractRegistry` layers AI metadata over the base contract registry, mapping each deployment to the model hash governing its inference logic【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L8-L35】. Contracts expose a dedicated `infer` entry point invoked through `InvokeAIContract`, allowing on‑chain transactions to trigger model evaluation within the virtual machine【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L39-L46】.

## Financial Forecasting Utilities
A common `PriceModel` interface supports multiple predictors—simple moving averages, linear regression and AR(1)—all available through `ForecastSeries`, which defaults to a three‑point moving average when no model is specified【F:financial_prediction.go†L7-L107】. These tools help authority nodes project revenue and plan liquidity months in advance.

## Quality Assurance
End‑to‑end tests exercise prediction APIs, marketplace flows, training controls, inference operations, drift and anomaly detection and secure storage to guarantee deterministic behaviour across modules【F:ai_modules_test.go†L8-L142】.

## Enterprise Governance and Branding
Every AI capability is engineered under Neto Solaris’s commitment to responsible innovation. Royalty tracking, auditable job metadata and encrypted model handling demonstrate how the platform aligns powerful machine intelligence with transparent governance and monetisation.

## Conclusion
By coupling predictive engines, lifecycle management, continuous monitoring and AI‑aware smart contracts, the Synnergy Network delivers a unified framework for secure, accountable artificial intelligence. Neto Solaris clients can deploy, monetise and evolve models directly within the blockchain ecosystem while maintaining rigorous operational control.
