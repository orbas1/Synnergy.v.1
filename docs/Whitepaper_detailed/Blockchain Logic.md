# Blockchain Logic – Stage 77 Cohesive Runtime

The Stage 77 upgrade unifies Synnergy’s blockchain logic across consensus,
execution, storage, wallet and governance layers by introducing a runtime
integration facade, hardened deployment artefacts and comprehensive testing.

## Core Runtime Orchestration

- `NewRuntimeIntegration` wires together the ledger, node, consensus engine,
  wallet and regulatory node, ensuring every entrypoint—CLI, Docker, Kubernetes,
  Terraform and the function web—operates against the same in-memory state and
  gas configuration【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L15-L192】.
- The CLI bootstrap now loads the gas table, validates required opcodes, starts
  the runtime integration and warms critical registries so commands are available
  immediately and behave consistently with automated pipelines【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L38-L125】.
- Health telemetry emitted by the integration is logged by the CLI and exposed to
  orchestration platforms, providing a unified view of ledger height, validator
  availability and wallet connectivity【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L133-L192】.

## Execution and Gas Discipline

- The virtual machine enforces gas budgets per opcode by consulting the shared
  gas table, while tests and runtime checks ensure every documented opcode has a
  corresponding price, preventing divergence between contracts, CLI tools and
  reference guides【F:virtual_machine.go†L24-L142】【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】【F:gas_table_test.go†L1-L42】.
- Consensus, cross-chain and authority workflows retain deterministic gas
  profiles, allowing documentation such as this whitepaper to describe economic
  behaviour with confidence.

## Infrastructure Alignment

- Docker images package node, wallet and web services with health checks,
  non-root execution and configuration mounts so local development mirrors
  production practices【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】.
- Kubernetes manifests deliver namespaces, service accounts, secrets, probes,
  autoscaling policies and network policies to maintain availability and
  observability across node roles【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】【F:deploy/k8s/wallet.yaml†L1-L108】.
- Terraform provisions VPCs, security groups, load balancers, autoscaling groups,
  encrypted parameters and audit databases to host the blockchain stack with
  enterprise-grade security and compliance controls【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L231】.

## Testing and Documentation

- Integration tests cover transaction submission, virtual machine execution and
  health monitoring, offering regression coverage for Stage 77’s runtime wiring
  and gas guarantees【F:integration_test.go†L5-L66】.
- Documentation—including module boundaries, production stages and this
  whitepaper—captures the runtime integration workflow, helping contributors and
  auditors follow how logic flows from CLI commands to infrastructure-as-code and
  browser-based tooling【F:docs/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md†L1-L30】【F:docs/PRODUCTION_STAGES.md†L145-L159】.

Stage 77 therefore transforms Synnergy’s blockchain logic into a cohesive,
enterprise-ready runtime that is observable, fault tolerant and accessible across
CLI, automation and the JavaScript function web.
