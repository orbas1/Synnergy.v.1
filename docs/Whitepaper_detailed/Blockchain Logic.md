# Blockchain Logic

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network delivers a multi‑layered blockchain where transaction validation, state management, and cross‑chain orchestration operate in concert. The platform combines proof‑of‑history (PoH), proof‑of‑stake (PoS), and proof‑of‑work (PoW) to finalise blocks while a modular virtual machine executes programmable logic. This document details the core components that underpin ledger integrity and network determinism.

## Block Structure and Lifecycle
Transactions first aggregate into **sub‑blocks** ordered by PoH and signed by a selected validator. Each sub‑block records its transaction list, validator identity, timestamp, PoH hash, and signature, ensuring deterministic ordering and PoS attestation【F:core/block.go†L10-L24】【F:core/block.go†L27-L37】. A full **block** then bundles validated sub‑blocks, references the previous block hash, and is sealed via a nonce that satisfies the PoW target derived from the header hash【F:core/block.go†L45-L67】. This three‑stage process—PoH sequencing, PoS validation, and PoW finalisation—anchors every block to an auditable chain of computation.

## Transaction Model
The transaction format captures sender, receiver, amount, fee, nonce, timestamp, signature, and type, with optional biometric hashes and embedded bytecode for contract execution【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L35】. Factory helpers deterministically derive transaction IDs before signing, ensuring reproducible hashes across nodes【F:core/transaction.go†L38-L53】. The hash routine incorporates all monetary fields and the biometric digest so any alteration invalidates the signature, while verification and biometric attachment enforce authentic user authorisation【F:core/transaction.go†L56-L72】【F:core/transaction.go†L74-L95】.

## Ledger State and UTXO Management
Balances, blocks, UTXO sets, and a mem‑pool reside within the ledger structure, protected by read–write locks for concurrent access【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L33】. Blocks appended through `AddBlock` persist to a write‑ahead log, allowing nodes to recover state after failure, and `ApplyTransaction` debits sender funds, credits recipients, and maintains UTXO entries atomically【F:core/ledger.go†L107-L170】. This ledger design preserves double‑spend resistance while providing deterministic replay of historical blocks.

## Node Responsibilities and Block Production
A node instance maintains its own ledger view, consensus engine, virtual machine, and stake map【F:core/node.go†L8-L33】. Incoming transactions pass through `ValidateTransaction` before entering the mem‑pool【F:core/node.go†L37-L56】. During block production the node selects an eligible validator, constructs a sub‑block, validates it via the consensus engine, mines the encompassing block, applies transactions to the ledger, and distributes fees proportionally to stakeholders【F:core/node.go†L58-L94】.

## Consensus Integration
`SynnergyConsensus` bootstraps with configurable weights (40% PoW, 30% PoS, 30% PoH) and exposes parameters for adaptive tuning as network demand and stake concentration fluctuate【F:core/consensus.go†L38-L52】. The `AdjustWeights` routine smooths updates, enforces minimum participation thresholds, and renormalises totals while honouring availability flags【F:core/consensus.go†L61-L89】. For PoW, `MineBlock` iterates nonces until the SHA‑256 header hash meets the difficulty requirement, embedding the result in the block header【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L206】.

## Genesis and Monetary Supply
`InitGenesis` mints the initial allocation, mines the first block, appends it to the ledger, and returns supply statistics alongside the starting consensus weights【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】. The function guards against re‑initialisation, ensuring the genesis block remains a unique anchor for the entire chain.

## Virtual Machine and Contract Execution
The lightweight **SimpleVM** interprets 24‑bit opcodes with a pluggable handler map and configurable concurrency limits, enabling nodes to execute embedded programs within transactions or registry contracts【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L11-L38】【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L49-L80】【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L96-L121】. Start/Stop controls and limiter channels provide resource governance across heavy, light, and super‑light modes.

## Validator Governance and Slashing
`ValidatorNode` combines base node behaviour with stake tracking and quorum enforcement, exposing methods to add, remove, or slash validators and to determine if quorum has been reached【F:core/validator_node.go†L5-L20】【F:core/validator_node.go†L23-L46】. Within the node core, staking enforces minimum deposits, while dedicated slashing handlers halve stake and flag misbehaving validators for offences such as double‑signing or downtime【F:core/node.go†L96-L132】.

## Cross‑Chain Coordination
The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges between external networks, authorises relayers, and tracks each bridge's source, target, and permitted relayer set in thread‑safe maps【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L90】. This foundation enables Blackridge deployments to exchange assets or messages across heterogeneous chains under controlled governance.

## Dynamic Consensus and Network Adaptation
The `ConsensusHopper` monitors transactions per second, network latency, and validator counts to switch between PoW, PoS, and PoH as conditions change【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L29】. Its `Evaluate` routine promotes PoS during high throughput, selects PoH when validator participation drops, and otherwise defaults to PoW, ensuring the chain maintains performance and security across varying loads【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L70】.

## High Availability and Energy Efficiency
`FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes the most recent backup when the primary node misses its timeout, sustaining service during outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L25】【F:high_availability.go†L42-L69】. To reduce environmental impact, `EnergyEfficiencyTracker` aggregates each validator's transactions per kilowatt hour and network averages, while `EnergyEfficientNode` issues sustainability certificates and throttles nodes that fall below efficiency thresholds【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L60】【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L74-L80】.

## Private Transactions and Zero‑Trust Data Exchange
AES‑GCM routines encrypt payloads and bundle the nonce for decryption, enabling the `PrivateTxManager` to queue confidential transactions without exposing plaintext【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L27】【F:private_transactions.go†L48-L74】. For off‑chain coordination, the `ZeroTrustEngine` opens ed25519‑backed channels where encrypted messages are signed and stored, allowing parties to verify and decrypt records on demand【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L47】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L50-L67】.

## Regulatory Compliance and Audit Nodes
`RegulatoryManager` catalogues jurisdictional rules and flags transactions that exceed configured limits【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L47】【F:regulatory_management.go†L64-L75】. Regulator‑operated nodes leverage this manager to approve or reject transfers and maintain immutable logs of flagged entities, providing a built‑in audit trail for oversight bodies【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】【F:regulatory_node.go†L35-L49】.

## Identity and Access Management
The AccessController enforces role‑based permissions while the IdentityService records verified user metadata and audit logs, ensuring only authorised, registered parties can initiate transactions or interact with on‑chain services【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】.

## Network Monitoring, Firewall, and Anomaly Detection
SystemHealthLogger captures runtime metrics for external inspection, Watchtower nodes stream these snapshots and log forks, the Firewall blocks malicious addresses, tokens, or IPs, and a streaming AnomalyDetector flags statistical outliers before they escalate into attacks【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】【F:firewall.go†L5-L66】【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Indexing and Geospatial Analytics
Indexing nodes maintain in‑memory key/value stores for low‑latency queries while Geospatial nodes record location traces, enabling enterprise deployments to couple ledger events with spatial context and accelerate lookups across regulatory domains【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L25】【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L39】.

## Security and Auditability
Biometric hashes within transactions tie on‑chain activity to verified identities, ledger WAL persistence ensures replayable history, and validator slashing deters malicious behaviour. Combined with consensus weight adjustments, zero‑trust channels, regulatory logging, and cross‑chain access controls, Blackridge’s blockchain logic offers a robust, auditable ledger designed for regulated environments.
