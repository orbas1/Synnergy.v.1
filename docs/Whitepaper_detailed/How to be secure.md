# How to Be Secure

As part of the Synnergy network, **Neto Solaris** is committed to delivering
an environment where contributors, validators and users can operate with
confidence. The platform’s design embraces a defence‑in‑depth strategy that
combines rigorous identity checks, encrypted communications, continuous
monitoring and strict governance. This section outlines the architectural
components and operational practices that keep Synnergy secure.

## Security Philosophy
- **Zero trust** – Every request is authenticated and authorised; nothing inside
  the network is implicitly trusted.
- **Layered defence** – Multiple safeguards (biometrics, role checks, firewalls,
  anomaly monitors) overlap so a single failure does not expose the system.
- **Auditability** – All sensitive operations emit verifiable logs that can be
  inspected by regulators and stakeholders.

## Identity and Access Management
### Biometric Verification
Nodes can require biometric signatures before executing privileged actions. The
`BiometricSecurityNode` couples an identifier with a biometric authenticator and
runs functions only after successful verification, returning errors when checks
fail【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L50】. Biometric templates are stored as SHA‑256
hashes and validated using ECDSA signatures, preventing replay or template theft
【F:biometrics_auth.go†L25-L45】.

### Role‑Based Access Control
Fine‑grained permissions are enforced with the `AccessController`, which grants
or revokes named roles for specific addresses and verifies membership during
runtime checks【F:access_control.go†L5-L48】.

### Identity Verification and Audit Trails
The `IdentityService` registers personal details for on‑ledger addresses and
records each verification method with timestamps, providing a persistent audit
trail for compliance teams【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L75】.

### ID Wallet Registration
Wallets can be bound to identity metadata via the `IDRegistry`, ensuring that
only registered wallets participate in sensitive workflows. Registration checks
prevent duplicates and expose helper methods to query registration status or
retrieve associated information【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L43】.

## Data Protection
### Secure Storage
Sensitive model or configuration data can be encrypted at rest through
`SecureStorage`. It seals payloads with AES‑GCM and a mandatory 32‑byte key,
ensuring confidentiality and integrity before the bytes reach disk【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L23-L75】.

### Zero‑Trust Data Channels
Real‑time communications traverse `ZeroTrustEngine` channels. Each channel holds
its own symmetric key and Ed25519 key pair; messages are encrypted, signed and
verified before delivery to prevent tampering or impersonation【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L114】.

### Private Transactions
Transactions requiring confidentiality are wrapped by the `PrivateTxManager`.
Payloads are encrypted with AES‑GCM and stored alongside their nonces so only
holders of the original key can decrypt them【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L79】.

## AI Model Integrity
To secure machine‑learning components, the `DriftMonitor` tracks baseline
metrics for each model hash and flags deviations that exceed configurable
thresholds. This protects automated decision systems from silent model drift
that could otherwise be exploited【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.

## Network and Node Hardening
### Firewall Enforcement
Every node ships with a lightweight `Firewall` that blocks malicious wallet
addresses, token identifiers or peer IPs through thread‑safe blocklists
【F:firewall.go†L5-L104】.

### Sandbox Execution for Smart Contracts
The `SandboxManager` isolates contract execution into dedicated sandboxes with
gas and memory limits, and supports start, stop, reset and deletion operations to
contain faulty or hostile contracts【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

### Virtual Machine Execution Controls
The `SimpleVM` interpreter enforces concurrency limits and per‑opcode gas usage,
rejecting execution when capacity is saturated or gas limits are exceeded. Unknown
opcodes fall back to a no‑op handler to maintain deterministic behaviour
【F:virtual_machine.go†L27-L156】.

### Resource Metering and Gas Accounting
To prevent denial‑of‑service through expensive opcodes, the `GasTable` assigns
explicit costs to every supported operation and caches them for fast lookup. The
table is populated from a reference manifest and exposes helpers to register
additional opcodes or query existing ones, ensuring predictable fees across
network upgrades【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】.

### Watchtower Monitoring and System Health Logging
`WatchtowerNode` instances observe the network, collect runtime metrics and report
forks while exposing an embedded firewall for quick remediation【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L95】.
Underlying metrics are provided by `SystemHealthLogger`, which records CPU usage,
memory allocation, peer counts and block heights for diagnostics【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】.

### Cross‑Chain Bridge Security
The `BridgeTransferManager` hashes transfer parameters into unique identifiers
and stores claims with proofs, preventing double spends and providing traceable
records for each cross‑chain deposit and withdrawal【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L49】【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L52-L66】.

## Behavioural Monitoring and Governance
### Anomaly Detection
A lightweight `AnomalyDetector` continuously updates statistical baselines and
flags outliers using z‑score thresholds, enabling early detection of suspicious
activity【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

### Compliance and Fraud Monitoring
The `ComplianceService` verifies KYC commitments, records fraud signals with
risk scores and maintains auditable trails for every address. Coupled with the
`ComplianceManager`, transactions involving suspended accounts are rejected
unless explicitly whitelisted【F:compliance.go†L61-L124】【F:compliance_management.go†L8-L78】.

### Stake Penalties
Validator accountability is enforced through the `StakePenaltyManager`, which
adjusts stake levels and records penalty histories whenever misbehaviour is
observed【F:stake_penalty.go†L16-L58】.

### Regulatory Oversight
`RegulatoryManager` keeps a registry of jurisdictional rules and evaluates
transactions for violations, while `RegulatoryNode` instances flag offending
addresses to satisfy compliance requirements【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L49】.

### Dynamic Consensus Adaptation
For resilience against targeted attacks or shifting network conditions, the
`ConsensusHopper` evaluates live metrics such as throughput, latency and active
validator counts to switch between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake and
proof‑of‑history modes, keeping block production stable under diverse loads
【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L71】.

## Operational Resilience and Recovery
### High Availability
`FailoverManager` monitors node heartbeats and automatically promotes the most
recently responsive backup when a primary node becomes unresponsive. This
ensures continued service during outages without manual intervention
【F:high_availability.go†L8-L70】.

### Incident Response
Documented runbooks should define escalation paths for suspected breaches. Logs
from watchtowers, compliance services and system health monitors provide the
forensic evidence needed to triage incidents and restore services rapidly.

## Operational Best Practices
- Keep node and wallet software updated to inherit the latest security patches.
- Rotate keys and biometric data periodically, revoking obsolete credentials.
- Review watchtower metrics and anomaly reports to respond to irregularities
  promptly.
- Use firewalls and sandbox controls to restrict untrusted peers and contracts.
- Maintain off‑chain backups of critical keys and configuration data in secure
  locations.
- Validate KYC documents and review compliance risk scores before engaging with
  new counterparties.
- Test failover procedures and restore processes regularly to guarantee recovery
  objectives.
- Keep incident response playbooks up to date and rehearse them with operations
  teams.

## Stage 78 Enterprise Enhancements
- **Security telemetry:** `core.NewEnterpriseOrchestrator` aggregates VM status, consensus registrations, wallet custody and gas documentation so security teams can monitor the environment via `synnergy orchestrator status` and the web dashboards during audits or incidents.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L21-L166】【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L6-L75】【F:web/pages/api/orchestrator.js†L1-L23】
- **Documented control costs:** Stage 78 gas entries record orchestrator-driven authority elections, audits, wallet sealing and node diagnostics, providing deterministic pricing for security operations across CLI, VM and GUI tooling.【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L420-L424】
- **Validated hardening:** Unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world orchestrator tests exercise failover, consensus adjustments and authority onboarding under adversarial scenarios, underpinning Synnergy’s defence-in-depth posture.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L5-L75】【F:cli/orchestrator_test.go†L5-L26】

## Conclusion
Security within the Synnergy ecosystem is not a single feature but a
comprehensive framework aligned with the standards of **Neto Solaris**
By combining robust cryptography, continuous monitoring and strong governance,
Synnergy equips participants with the tools needed to operate safely in a
hostile digital landscape.
