# Maintenance

## Overview
Neto Solaris treats maintenance as a continuous discipline that safeguards network reliability, security, and sustainability. Every node and service is designed with lifecycle controls so operators can apply updates, collect metrics, and retire resources without disrupting the broader ecosystem.

Stage 79 introduces an enterprise bootstrap workflow that surfaces maintenance diagnostics before and after interventions. Running `synnergy orchestrator bootstrap --replicate` executes `core.EnterpriseOrchestrator.BootstrapNetwork`, returning a signed snapshot of VM status, consensus networks, authority counts and replication activity so teams can validate baseline health ahead of upgrades or failovers.【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L58-L117】【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L71-L209】 Startup synchronises Stage 79 gas metadata with documentation, while the control panel mirrors the same bootstrap form to align CLI automation, dashboards and browser tooling on readiness signals and pricing.【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L63-L106】【F:web/pages/index.js†L1-L214】【F:web/pages/api/bootstrap.js†L1-L45】 Bootstrap tests cover unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world flows to ensure maintenance preserves security, privacy and regulatory compliance even under demanding workloads.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L73-L178】

## Maintenance Principles at Neto Solaris
1. **Proactivity** – anticipate failures through telemetry and predictive analysis.
2. **Security First** – apply zero‑trust design patterns and cryptographic verification for every maintenance action.
3. **Energy Awareness** – track efficiency and carbon offsets to maintain a sustainable footprint.
4. **Automated Recovery** – promote resilient architectures that recover without manual intervention.

## Proactive Node Monitoring
### System Health
Nodes expose runtime telemetry through the `SystemHealthLogger`, which captures CPU usage, memory consumption, peer count, and block height for external dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L34】. This snapshot interface enables real‑time diagnostics and capacity planning.

### High Availability & Failover
The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes a standby when the primary becomes unresponsive, ensuring continuity during maintenance windows or unexpected outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

### Sustainability Tracking
`EnergyEfficientNode` instances record energy usage, accumulate offset credits, and issue sustainability certificates. Nodes can be throttled when efficiency falls below a configured threshold, aligning maintenance with environmental goals【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L80】. Network operators also consult the `EnergyEfficiencyTracker` to calculate per‑validator and fleet‑wide transactions‑per‑kilowatt metrics, ensuring capacity upgrades target the least efficient segments first【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】.

### Watchtower Oversight
Distributed watchtower nodes observe peer behaviour, collect metrics, and surface fork events. Each node runs a dedicated firewall and health logger, allowing operators to investigate anomalies without interrupting production traffic【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L95】.

### Environmental Conditions
Edge deployments may attach sensors to track heat, humidity, or other site factors. The `EnvironmentalMonitoringNode` records threshold rules and triggers alerts when sensor data deviates, enabling pre‑emptive hardware maintenance in harsh environments【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L64】.

## Secure and Resilient Operations
### Dynamic Consensus Windows
Administrators may override automatic heuristics with `SetMode` to pin the network to a specific consensus mechanism during upgrades. Evaluation routines consider live TPS, latency, and validator counts to restore optimal settings once maintenance is complete【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L43-L70】.

### Sandbox Lifecycle Management
Smart‑contract execution occurs within managed sandboxes. Operators can start, stop, reset, or delete individual sandboxes, freeing resources and isolating faults without affecting other workloads【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

### Zero‑Trust Data Channels
Maintenance communications rely on encrypted channels with signature verification. `ZeroTrustEngine` instances create, send over, and eventually close secure channels, preventing tampering and limiting exposure after tasks conclude【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L113】.

### Adaptive Firewall Rules
Every maintenance window includes a review of live firewall policies. Administrators can block wallets, tokens, or IP ranges in real time, ensuring vulnerable endpoints are isolated before upgrades proceed【F:firewall.go†L5-L103】.

### Privileged Access Controls
Role‑based permissions restrict maintenance tooling to vetted personnel. The `AccessController` grants or revokes roles for addresses, enabling granular delegation of operational duties【F:access_control.go†L5-L63】. For highly sensitive actions, a `BiometricSecurityNode` requires biometric proof and signature validation before executing privileged functions, preventing credential reuse or session hijacking【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L45】.

## AI‑Assisted Predictive Maintenance
AI models monitor their own performance through `DriftMonitor`, comparing live metrics against established baselines. Detected drift signals the need for retraining or model replacement before accuracy degrades, supporting proactive maintenance of intelligent subsystems【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.

### Streaming Anomaly Detection
Operational telemetry feeds into a lightweight `AnomalyDetector` that maintains rolling statistics and flags outliers. Sudden spikes in latency or memory usage raise alerts, giving engineers time to remediate issues before they escalate【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Governance and Regulatory Oversight
Regulatory managers catalogue jurisdiction‑specific rules and evaluate transactions for violations, while regulator‑operated nodes flag suspicious addresses and retain immutable audit logs. These components embed compliance directly into routine maintenance workflows【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L44】.

## Operational Workflow
1. **Monitor:** aggregate system metrics and sustainability data.
2. **Plan:** schedule upgrades using consensus overrides and failover routing to minimize disruption.
3. **Execute:** apply patches or configuration changes within isolated sandboxes and encrypted channels.
4. **Verify:** run health checks and snapshot audits to confirm stability.
5. **Report:** archive metrics and sustainability certificates for compliance.

## Reporting and Compliance
Maintenance activities generate auditable artifacts—health snapshots, failover events, energy certificates, anomaly flags, and regulatory logs—that feed governance dashboards and statutory disclosures. This transparency upholds Neto Solaris’s commitment to accountable infrastructure management.

## Audit Trails & Forensic Logging
`SystemHealthLogger` snapshots and regulatory node flags are retained for long‑term forensics, allowing investigators to reconstruct incident timelines and verify remediation steps【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】【F:regulatory_node.go†L35-L49】.

## Stage 79 Enhancements
- **Bootstrap-aligned service plane.** The Stage 79 runtime initialises the virtual machine, ledger, consensus manager, wallet and shared registries in one guarded routine so maintenance tooling, the CLI and the web console run against identical infrastructure without manual wiring【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap.go†L17-L142】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L18-L55】.
- **Deterministic maintenance gas and opcodes.** Ledger replication, primary election, privacy envelopes and compliance disbursement gained documented opcodes and gas ceilings, allowing runbooks to budget failover and audit flows with deterministic costs before interventions begin【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L240-L404】【F:docs/reference/opcodes_list.md†L260-L700】【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L820-L839】.
- **Remote manifest-driven runbooks.** Operations teams can export the full CLI manifest and stream it into the React control panel, enabling secured browser sessions to preview flags, enforce dry-run execution and log remediation output without SSH access to production nodes【F:cli/gui_manifest.go†L20-L118】【F:web/pages/api/commands.js†L1-L29】【F:web/pages/api/run.js†L1-L21】【F:web/pages/index.js†L87-L200】.
- **Runtime validation coverage.** Automated tests now assert that gas catalogues are registered before maintenance workflows execute and that manifest exports remain machine readable, providing regression coverage for Stage 79 orchestration features【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap_test.go†L10-L41】【F:cli/gui_cmd_test.go†L11-L82】.

## Conclusion
By weaving proactive monitoring, secure automation, and sustainability into every layer, Neto Solaris delivers a maintenance framework that keeps the Synnergy Network dependable and future‑ready. Operators can service the network confidently, knowing critical functions remain resilient throughout each maintenance cycle.
