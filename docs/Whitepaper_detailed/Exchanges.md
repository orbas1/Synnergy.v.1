# Exchanges

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered and operated by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, enables fluid exchange of value across tokens, liquidity pools and external chains. Exchange mechanics are built directly into the protocol to support enterprise settlement, retail trading and cross‑border payments without compromising security or regulatory auditability.

## Token Standards Driving Exchange
### SYN10 – Central Bank Digital Currency
`SYN10Token` embeds a concurrency‑safe ledger and tracks issuer information alongside a mutable fiat exchange rate, allowing central banks to adjust parity while preserving total supply data【F:internal/tokens/syn10.go†L1-L41】.

### SYN3400 – Forex Pair Registry
The `ForexRegistry` registers currency pairs and records time‑stamped rate updates so markets can query live foreign‑exchange data or integrate external price feeds【F:internal/tokens/syn3400.go†L10-L44】.

### SYN3500 – Stable Value Token
`SYN3500Token` models centrally issued or asset‑backed stablecoins with an adjustable exchange rate and mint/redeem hooks for monetary policy control【F:core/syn3500_token.go†L8-L41】.

### SYN2100 – Trade‑Finance Liquidity
`TradeFinanceToken` tracks invoices and maintains pooled liquidity balances, enabling financiers to deposit or withdraw capital against on‑chain trade documents【F:core/syn2100.go†L9-L107】.

### SYN20 – Programmable Utility Token
`SYN20Token` extends the base token model with enterprise safeguards such as global pause controls and address‑level freezing, enabling regulated markets to halt or quarantine balances without disrupting accounting integrity【F:internal/tokens/syn20.go†L8-L63】.

### SYN223 – Whitelist/Blacklist Enforcement
For jurisdictions requiring strict participant vetting, `SYN223Token` enforces whitelist and blacklist policies during every transfer and exposes administrative tooling to revoke or approve counterparties in real time【F:internal/tokens/syn223_token.go†L8-L78】.

## Decentralised Exchange Infrastructure
### Constant‑Product Automated Market Maker
A native AMM supports token swaps and liquidity provisioning through a constant‑product formula. Pools track reserves, fee basis points and LP balances while guarding state with mutexes for deterministic settlement. Liquidity providers receive LP tokens proportional to their contribution, and swaps deduct fees before recomputing the invariant `k = x*y` to derive deterministic output amounts【F:core/liquidity_pools.go†L9-L106】.

### Liquidity Views and Monitoring
`LiquidityPoolView` snapshots pool state for read‑only inspection, powering dashboards and the DEX screener to surface reserves and fees in real time【F:core/liquidity_views.go†L1-L24】.

### CLI and GUI Tooling
Operators interact with pools using the `liquidity_pools` CLI to create pools, add liquidity, execute swaps or remove positions【F:cli/liquidity_pools.go†L12-L99】. The companion `liquidity_views` commands list pools or display individual metrics for monitoring interfaces【F:cli/liquidity_views.go†L10-L33】. A convenience command `dex liquidity <pair>` exposes on‑chain reserves for external tooling and GUIs【F:README.md†L140-L146】.

### Opcode and Gas Integration
Liquidity management and view operations are exposed as first‑class SNVM opcodes, allowing automated market tools and smart contracts to invoke pool creation, swaps and snapshot queries with deterministic gas pricing【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L846-L854】【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L994-L996】.

## Cross‑Chain Asset Exchange
### Bridge and Relayer Management
The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges between networks and authorises relayer addresses, enabling controlled asset flows across heterogeneous chains【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L49】.

### Transfer Lifecycle
`BridgeTransferManager` locks deposits, tracks proofs and releases claims, while the `TransactionManager` records lock‑and‑mint or burn‑and‑release events for full auditability【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L66】【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】.

### Connection Tracking
The `ConnectionManager` logs opening and closing of links between chains, preserving historical metadata so enterprise operators can audit when and where cross‑network channels were active【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L77】.

### CLI Automation
Bridge configuration, transfer deposits and claims are automated through dedicated CLIs that return gas metrics and optional JSON for integration. `cross_chain` manages bridge registration and relayer authorization, while `cross_chain_bridge` handles deposits, proofs and ledger queries【F:cli/cross_chain.go†L15-L99】【F:cli/cross_chain_bridge.go†L16-L112】.

## Security, Compliance and Governance
### Transaction Integrity
Exchange‑rate updates and liquidity operations are guarded by mutexes and explicit error checks, ensuring thread‑safe accounting and preventing unauthorized withdrawals【F:core/syn3500_token.go†L26-L41】【F:core/syn2100.go†L92-L107】. Token standards add further controls: `SYN20Token` can pause mint/burn and freeze individual addresses, and `SYN223Token` rejects transfers unless recipients are whitelisted and not blacklisted【F:internal/tokens/syn20.go†L24-L88】【F:internal/tokens/syn223_token.go†L33-L76】. Bridge managers capture proofs and state transitions so regulators can reconcile cross‑chain events against authoritative logs【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L35-L66】.

### Compliance Enforcement and KYC
The `ComplianceManager` centrally records suspended addresses and whitelists, reviewing each transaction to block interactions with flagged parties【F:core/compliance_management.go†L10-L76】. Enterprise operators extend these rules from the command line through the `compliance` CLI, which validates and erases KYC documents, records fraud signals, audits account histories and runs anomaly detection or ZKP verification with optional JSON output for SIEM pipelines【F:cli/compliance.go†L31-L160】.

### Regulatory Oversight
Jurisdictional policy is codified by `RegulatoryManager`, which stores per‑region rules such as transaction limits and evaluates them for violations【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】. `RegulatoryNode` instances apply these rules in real time, flagging offending addresses and preserving an immutable log for external auditors【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L50】.

### Transaction Controls and Privacy
Enterprises can schedule transactions for future execution or cancellation, freeze funds for authority‑approved reversals and encrypt payloads using AES‑GCM for confidential settlement【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L136】.

### Deterministic Gas Accounting
A central gas table enumerates opcode costs so wallets, CLIs and monitoring systems can price liquidity operations, bridge transfers and compliance checks deterministically across the network【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】.

## Future Roadmap
A dedicated `TokenExchange` smart contract scaffold is reserved for advanced DEX logic, including order books and programmatic fee routing【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenExchange.sol†L1-L6】.

## Conclusion
Through integrated token standards, AMM liquidity pools and cross‑chain bridges, the Synnergy Network by **Blackridge Group Ltd.** delivers a comprehensive, regulated environment for exchanging digital and real‑world assets. Ongoing work on exchange contracts and monitoring tooling will further expand market depth and interoperability across the ecosystem.
