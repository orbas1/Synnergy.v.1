# Technical Architecture

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network is built as a modular blockchain platform combining flexible consensus, a programmable virtual machine, AI-enhanced smart contracts, cross-chain interoperability, and rigorous security. This document details the architectural layers and core components underlying the system.

## Layered System Design
### Network and Consensus Layer
The network utilises a dynamic hybrid consensus engine that balances proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake and proof‑of‑history through configurable weightings. Parameters such as Alpha, Beta and Gamma govern thresholds while availability flags allow algorithms to be toggled without code changes【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L52】. A smoothing routine normalises weights and clamps them above a minimum floor to maintain liveness under changing demand or stake concentrations【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L88】. To complement this weighting system, a ConsensusHopper observes live throughput, latency and validator counts and seamlessly switches between proof modes when thresholds are met【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L29】【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L70】.

### Cross‑Chain Interoperability
A dedicated CrossChainManager registers bridges between external networks, tracks authorised relayers and exposes APIs for listing or retrieving bridge configurations【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L48】. Global relayer whitelists can be updated atomically, enabling or revoking access across all bridges in one operation【F:cross_chain.go†L70-L90】.
Bridge operations are tracked through a BridgeTransferManager that locks assets and records claims so deposits and releases remain auditable across networks【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L48】【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L52-L67】. A ConnectionManager maintains the lifecycle of inter-chain links, marking openings and closures with timestamps for historical tracing【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L47】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L45-L58】. For asset movements, a TransactionManager logs lock‑and‑mint or burn‑and‑release flows and exposes queries to list or retrieve transactions by identifier【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L48】【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L50-L88】.

Protocol standards are catalogued in a chain‑agnostic registry so new cross‑network formats can be adopted without touching bridge code. Each entry receives a unique identifier and can be queried or enumerated to negotiate capabilities with external chains【F:cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go†L10-L45】. Complementing this, a cross‑chain contract registry maps local contract addresses to their remote counterparts and supports updates or removals as integrations evolve【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L5-L50】.

To support off‑chain scaling, a SidechainRegistry tracks side networks, their latest headers and validator sets while allowing administrators to pause, resume or update validator lists as governance demands change【F:core/sidechains.go†L8-L120】. A PlasmaBridge exposes deposit and exit routines that let users safely migrate assets between the base chain and plasma sidechains, recording exit nonces and finalisation status for auditability【F:core/plasma_operations.go†L5-L40】. For lightweight participants a LightNode retains only block headers, enabling quick verification of chain progress without maintaining a full ledger copy【F:core/light_node.go†L5-L28】.

### Virtual Machine and Smart Contracts
Synnergy ships with a lightweight SimpleVM that interprets 24‑bit opcodes and supports resource‑constrained profiles. Instances scale from heavy nodes to super‑light deployments while shared handlers and concurrency limiters enforce deterministic execution【F:virtual_machine.go†L11-L38】【F:virtual_machine.go†L49-L79】. During execution the VM slices bytecode into opcodes, meters gas per operation and halts on errors or exceeded limits【F:virtual_machine.go†L121-L178】.

Contract governance is handled by a ContractManager that can transfer ownership, pause or resume execution and upgrade deployed bytecode while preserving metadata【F:contract_management.go†L5-L70】. For AI‑driven workflows an AIContractRegistry layers model hashes over the base registry and exposes inference-specific invocation paths【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L8-L49】.

Sandboxed execution environments add another safety layer. The SandboxManager provisions isolated sandboxes with explicit gas and memory ceilings, supports lifecycle operations and tracks timestamps for auditing【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L51】【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L53-L105】.

### Language Compatibility and Opcode Catalogue
The Synnergy VM accepts contracts authored in multiple languages—ranging from WASM and Golang to Solidity and Python—and verifies support through a compatibility list that can be queried by tooling or deployment scripts【F:contract_language_compatibility.go†L5-L27】. Execution semantics are standardised by a comprehensive opcode table that maps every exposed function to a deterministic 24‑bit code, ensuring compiled contracts can invoke system utilities consistently across upgrades【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L1-L33】.

### Fee Management and Gas Tracking
To keep transaction costs predictable, Synnergy maintains a GasTable mapping opcode names to base fees and loading pricing data from reference tables at startup【F:gas_table.go†L13-L46】. The loader caches parsed values and falls back to a default cost when an opcode is missing or malformed【F:gas_table.go†L47-L75】. Utilities allow runtime registration or resetting of gas prices so administrators can surface new operations and refresh pricing without restarting nodes【F:gas_table.go†L77-L107】.

### AI Integration and Data Intelligence
Synnergy's AI stack includes a marketplace for trading models, drift detection to maintain accuracy, and encrypted storage for model assets. The ModelMarketplace registers listings and enforces ownership rules, enabling dynamic updates and removals【F:ai_model_management.go†L9-L98】. DriftMonitor tracks performance metrics against stored baselines and flags deviations beyond configurable thresholds【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】. Model artifacts are protected through AES‑GCM encryption using the SecureStorage service【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L12-L44】【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L47-L75】. TrainingManager orchestrates dataset‑driven jobs, tracking their lifecycle and supporting cancellation or completion of running tasks【F:ai_training.go†L10-L49】【F:ai_training.go†L71-L86】. An InferenceEngine loads model artifacts, executes deterministic runs and analyses batches of transactions for fraud scores to surface high‑risk activity【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L9-L53】.

### Data Distribution and Storage
Content distribution is coordinated by the DataDistribution registry, which maps datasets to serving nodes and prunes entries when offerings are revoked, ensuring up‑to‑date location metadata for clients【F:data_distribution.go†L5-L72】. Applications can publish real‑time feeds via DataFeed objects that support atomic updates and snapshots for auditability【F:data_operations.go†L8-L69】. Larger binaries are managed with the DataResourceManager, which tracks byte usage and returns isolated copies to callers【F:data_resource_management.go†L5-L66】. ContentNetworkNode instances maintain per‑node catalogs of hosted assets, enabling discovery and deregistration as resources appear or retire【F:content_node.go†L5-L55】.

### Node Services and Availability
The FailoverManager tracks node heartbeats and promotes backups whenever primaries miss timeouts, delivering automatic recovery across clusters【F:high_availability.go†L8-L45】. IndexingNode instances cache ledger data in-memory for rapid retrieval through thread‑safe insert, query and delete operations【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L27】. StakingNode maintains per-address stakes and total locked value, supporting lightweight staking flows without a full ledger backend【F:staking_node.go†L5-L27】【F:staking_node.go†L39-L47】. A controlled Faucet service dispenses limited test funds, enforcing per‑address cooldowns and configurable withdrawal limits to prevent abuse【F:faucet.go†L9-L38】.

### Specialized Node Types
Beyond core validators, the network supports specialised roles. EnergyEfficientNode instances generate sustainability certificates and report efficiency and carbon offsets for green-compliance deployments【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L80】. EnvironmentalMonitoringNode evaluates sensor feeds against threshold conditions to trigger on-chain actions【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L65】. GeospatialNode retains location histories for tracked subjects【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L46】, while MobileMiningNode throttles mining on battery-powered devices when charge drops below configured levels【F:mobile_mining_node.go†L8-L64】.

### Security and Compliance Services
A built‑in Firewall maintains block lists for wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs, allowing nodes to enforce network rules with thread‑safe operations for adding, removing or enumerating restrictions【F:firewall.go†L5-L44】. IdentityService captures user metadata and verification logs, guarding registration against duplicates and recording each verification attempt for compliance audits【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】【F:identity_verification.go†L60-L75】. A RegulatoryManager catalogs jurisdictional rules and checks transactions against maximum allowed amounts, returning any policy identifiers that are breached【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L25】【F:regulatory_management.go†L27-L74】. Role-based authorization is enforced through an AccessController that grants or revokes roles per address and exposes queries for permission checks【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】【F:access_control.go†L50-L62】. The ComplianceManager tracks suspensions and whitelists and reviews transactions against these policies before propagation【F:compliance_management.go†L15-L104】. Validators are subject to the StakePenaltyManager, which adjusts stake balances and records penalty history for misbehavior【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L61】. RegulatoryNode deployments work alongside the manager to approve or flag transactions, logging rule violations per address for audit trails【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L43】. For high-assurance operations, a BiometricSecurityNode couples nodes with template-based verification, gating sensitive functions behind enrolled biometric signatures【F:biometric_security_node.go†L1-L37】【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】.
Supplementary hardening modules underpin these services. An Encryptor and KeyManager provide basic key rotation primitives for symmetric encryption【F:internal/security/encryption.go†L4-L19】【F:internal/security/key_management.go†L5-L22】, while a SecretsManager stores sensitive configuration values in memory and now validates key usage via a simple CLI【F:internal/security/secrets_manager.go†L3-L39】. A PatchManager records applied updates for audit purposes【F:internal/security/patch_manager.go†L3-L15】. RateLimiter and DDoSMitigator components throttle requests and block abusive peers to protect network resources【F:internal/security/rate_limiter.go†L5-L18】【F:internal/security/ddos_mitigation.go†L3-L15】.

### Privacy and Zero‑Trust Channels
The PrivateTxManager pools encrypted payloads using AES‑GCM and provides retrieval only to authorised parties【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L46】【F:private_transactions.go†L55-L74】. For escrowed communications the ZeroTrustEngine opens channels with ephemeral Ed25519 keys, signs ciphertext and verifies signatures before decryption【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L47】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L50-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L101】.

### Observability and Operational Insight
WatchtowerNode instances monitor the network, gathering system health metrics and reporting forks via dedicated logging routines【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L52】. Metrics are sourced from a SystemHealthLogger that samples runtime statistics and exposes snapshots for dashboards or automation【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】. An EnergyEfficiencyTracker logs per-validator throughput and electricity consumption to calculate transactions per kilowatt hour and network averages【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】.

### Analytics and Predictive Services
An AnomalyDetector streams metrics and applies a z‑score threshold to surface outliers in real time, updating running mean and variance for each observation【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. For forward‑looking insights, the financial forecasting library offers moving‑average, linear‑regression and autoregressive models to project asset prices across multiple months【F:financial_prediction.go†L7-L107】.

### Transaction and Wallet Foundations
Core transaction objects capture sender and recipient addresses, amounts, fees and nonces while optionally embedding bytecode programs and biometric hashes to tie payments to verified identities【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L35】【F:core/transaction.go†L56-L95】. Wallets generate ECDSA key pairs, derive deterministic addresses and can sign, verify or securely persist private keys using scrypt‑derived AES‑GCM encryption【F:core/wallet.go†L19-L56】【F:core/wallet.go†L71-L150】. Genesis wallet allocations seed ecosystem funds and a helper routine distributes fees across internal development, charity and validator pools at network genesis【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L58】.

### Client and Wallet Services
A lightweight wallet service exposes HTTP endpoints for health checks and deterministic wallet creation, enabling external platforms to provision addresses programmatically. The server wires request handlers and logs events for operational visibility【F:walletserver/handlers.go†L5-L29】【F:walletserver/main.go†L9-L18】.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
Blackridge Group Ltd. distributes official container images through a multistage Docker build that packages both the node and wallet server binaries【F:docker/Dockerfile†L3-L25】. Production clusters can be orchestrated with the provided Kubernetes deployment manifest, which defines resource limits, health probes and service exposure for Synnergy nodes【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L71】. For cloud environments, Terraform modules provision VPC networking, security groups and an autoscaling group to roll out fault-tolerant nodes across availability zones【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L104】.

## Conclusion
Through this layered architecture, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a resilient, extensible and secure foundation for decentralised applications. The Synnergy Network integrates adaptive consensus, a programmable execution environment, AI-aware contracts and comprehensive governance tooling to support both enterprise and community deployments.
