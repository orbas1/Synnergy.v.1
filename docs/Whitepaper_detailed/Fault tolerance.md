# Fault Tolerance

Neto Solaris's Synnergy network is engineered for continuous operation even in the presence of software faults, hardware failures, or malicious activity. The platform combines proactive monitoring, redundant infrastructure, and secure isolation to maintain service availability and data integrity.

## Failover and High Availability

- **Automatic node promotion.** The `FailoverManager` tracks heartbeat timestamps for a primary and its backups, promoting the most recently responsive node when the primary exceeds a configurable timeout【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.
- **Orchestrated replication.** Kubernetes manifests provision multiple node replicas with health probes to enable rolling upgrades and rapid recovery from pod failure【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L47】.
- **Elastic scaling.** Terraform auto‑scaling groups maintain a baseline of Synnergy nodes across availability zones and automatically replace failed instances to preserve quorum【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L21-L94】.

## Replication and Data Distribution

- **Ledger propagation.** The `Replicator` spreads new blocks or snapshots to peers, maintaining a record of hashes that have successfully propagated【F:core/replication.go†L5-L49】.
- **Initialization service.** `InitService` wraps the replicator, bootstrapping a ledger and exposing start/stop controls for command‑line management【F:core/initialization_replication.go†L5-L37】.
- **Content availability.** `DataDistribution` tracks which nodes offer a given dataset, removing entries when no replicas remain to avoid stale pointers【F:data_distribution.go†L5-L71】.
- **In‑memory indexing.** `IndexingNode` mirrors ledger state into a key/value store so nodes can reconstruct query indexes instantly after a restart【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L33】.
- **Snapshot feeds.** `DataFeed` captures external dataset updates with timestamps, providing a consistent recovery point for off‑chain information【F:data_operations.go†L8-L45】.

## Backup and State Recovery

- **Compressed snapshots.** `CompressLedger` and companion utilities persist the entire ledger as gzip‑compressed JSON, enabling portable backups and rapid restoration without replaying every block【F:core/blockchain_compression.go†L20-L84】.

## Continuous Monitoring and Fault Detection

- **Watchtower oversight.** `WatchtowerNode` instances run separate monitoring loops that collect runtime metrics and log detected forks, ensuring rapid visibility into network anomalies【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L86】.
- **Runtime metrics.** `SystemHealthLogger` gathers goroutine counts, memory usage, peer count, and block height to provide a real‑time health snapshot for operations teams【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L44】.
- **Failover validation.** Unit tests simulate missed heartbeats to confirm that backups become active when primaries stall【F:high_availability_test.go†L8-L21】.

## Predictive Analytics and Self-Healing

- **Streaming anomaly scoring.** `AnomalyDetector` maintains running mean and variance to flag outliers beyond a configurable z‑score threshold, allowing nodes to quarantine unstable components before issues cascade【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.
- **Model drift sensing.** `DriftMonitor` records baseline accuracy for deployed models and reports deviations that exceed tolerances, prompting automated retraining or rollback before bad predictions propagate【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.
- **Environmental triggers.** `EnvironmentalMonitoringNode` ingests sensor readings and evaluates rule‑based conditions, enabling automatic shutdown or migration when physical factors threaten hardware integrity【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L65】.

## Security and Isolation for Resilience

- **Network firewalling.** The `Firewall` component maintains blocklists for wallets, tokens, and IPs, allowing addresses to be quarantined without touching the rest of the system【F:firewall.go†L5-L103】.
- **Zero‑trust channels.** `ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted, signed data channels so compromised peers cannot tamper with or replay messages【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L113】.
- **Sandboxed execution.** The `SandboxManager` creates isolated environments for smart contracts, enforcing gas and memory limits and allowing faulty sandboxes to be reset or deleted without affecting others【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

## Cross‑Chain Fallback Paths

- `ConnectionManager` records active links to external blockchains, enabling transactions to be rerouted or isolated if the primary chain experiences instability【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L42】.

## Holographic Data Resilience

- **Erasure-coded storage.** `SplitHolographic` divides payloads into multiple shards that can be distributed across disparate nodes so that any subset of surviving shards can be reassembled into the original data set【F:holographic.go†L3-L24】.
- **Lossless reconstruction.** `ReconstructHolographic` concatenates available shards to restore the original byte stream, allowing services to recover files even when some replicas are missing【F:holographic.go†L26-L36】.

## Stake‑Based Quarantine and Slashing

- **Penalty tracking.** `StakePenaltyManager` maintains validator stakes, accrued penalty points, and an immutable history of `PenaltyRecord` entries so operators can rapidly isolate nodes that violate protocol guarantees【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L52】.
- **Automated restitution.** Authorized controllers adjust stake levels through `AdjustStake`, enabling collateral to be reduced or replenished based on audit findings without disrupting healthy participants【F:stake_penalty.go†L32-L39】.

## Operational Runbooks and Health Snapshots

- **Fault check script.** The `fault_check.sh` utility invokes the `system_health snapshot` command to capture point-in-time metrics for diagnostics and post‑mortem analysis【F:cmd/scripts/fault_check.sh†L1-L4】.

## Adaptive Consensus and Recovery

`ConsensusHopper` evaluates transaction throughput, network latency, and validator participation to select the most resilient consensus algorithm at runtime, enabling graceful degradation under stress【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L70】.

## Validation and Testing for Enterprise Reliability

- **End‑to‑end harness.** Integration tests start the wallet server, broadcast transactions, and verify propagation across multiple nodes, exercising the full stack under realistic conditions【F:tests/e2e/network_harness_test.go†L43-L98】.
- **Fuzzing campaigns.** Network fuzz tests continuously supply malformed inputs to surface edge‑case failures before they reach production【F:tests/fuzz/network_fuzz_test.go†L5-L7】.

## Governance and Auditability

- **Identity verification.** `IdentityService` registers participants and logs verification events to maintain accountable user provenance during recovery workflows【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L56】.
- **Regulatory oversight.** `RegulatoryNode` evaluates transactions against policy rules and flags suspicious entities for follow‑up, preserving an auditable trail even amid network disruptions【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】.

## Stage 78 Enterprise Enhancements
- **Unified failure reporting:** `core.NewEnterpriseOrchestrator` exposes VM status, consensus registries, wallet availability and gas documentation so operators can poll `synnergy orchestrator status` or the web dashboards for a single view of resilience before and during incident response.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L21-L166】【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L6-L75】
- **Deterministic recovery costs:** Stage 78 gas entries document orchestrator-driven authority elections, audits and wallet sealing, ensuring recovery playbooks carry predictable resource requirements across CLI, VM and UI workflows.【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L420-L424】【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L325-L329】
- **Comprehensive testing:** The orchestrator’s unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world tests validate failover behaviour under network congestion, consensus reconfiguration and cross-chain bridging, reinforcing Synnergy’s enterprise fault-tolerance guarantees.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L5-L75】【F:cli/orchestrator_test.go†L5-L26】

## Conclusion

Through layered redundancy, rigorous monitoring, strong isolation boundaries, and formal governance controls, Neto Solaris's Synnergy network delivers a fault‑tolerant foundation for decentralised applications. The combination of automated failover, replicated data services, adaptive consensus, exhaustive testing, and hardened security controls ensures that mission‑critical workloads remain available even when components fail or adversaries attempt disruption.
