# How to Set Up the Synnergy Blockchain

*Neto Solaris*

## Overview
The Synnergy framework is a modular, high‑performance blockchain built in Go. Its pluggable architecture allows organisations to compose customised networks featuring validator, mining, staking, regulatory and watchtower roles. This guide provides a comprehensive walk‑through for preparing infrastructure, compiling binaries and bootstrapping a Synnergy network using the open‑source toolset maintained by **Neto Solaris**

## 1. Prerequisites
### Hardware & Network
- 4+ CPU cores and 8 GB RAM per node
- Stable broadband connection; low‑latency links for validator clusters
- 40 GB free storage for ledger growth and contract artefacts

### Software Stack
- **Go 1.24+** – required for all binaries (verify with `go version`)
- **Git** for source management
- **Make** for convenience targets and scripted builds
- **jq**, **curl** and other POSIX tools used by automation scripts
- **Docker / Kubernetes / Terraform** optional for containerised or cloud deployments
- **OpenSSL** and `bash` utilities for certificate and script operations

Execute `scripts/install_dependencies.sh` to bootstrap these packages on a clean system.

## 2. Obtain the Source
```bash
git clone https://example.com/Synnergy.v.1.git
cd Synnergy.v.1
```
The repository layout follows a clean separation between command‑line entry points (`cmd/`), modular CLI commands (`cli/`), runtime components (`core/`), and deployment manifests (`deploy/`, `docker/`).

## 3. Build the Binaries
The primary node binary lives under `cmd/synnergy` and orchestrates network services.
```bash
make build                 # invokes `go build ./...`
# build with explicit tags
make build-prod            # production optimisations

# or build just the node
go build ./cmd/synnergy
```
Successful compilation produces a `synnergy` executable at the repository root. Additional commands such as `watchtower`, `p2p-node`, or `smart_contracts` can be built using the same pattern. Run `make test` afterwards to ensure the workspace compiles and all unit tests pass.

## 4. Configure the Environment
Synnergy consumes a YAML configuration resolved from the `SYN_CONFIG` environment variable. If unset, `internal/config/default.go` points to `configs/dev.yaml` for development defaults.
```yaml
environment: development
log_level: debug
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8080
database:
  url: "https://dev-db.example.com"
```
Additional templates reside in `configs/prod.yaml` and `configs/test.yaml`. Duplicate a template and adjust values for staging or production. Configuration keys are validated with `github.com/go-playground/validator` ensuring correct log levels and port ranges.

Network parameters such as chain IDs or bootstrap peers can be centralised in `configs/network.yaml`.

Create an optional `.env` file to pre‑set environment variables; the entry point loads it via `gotenv.Load()`.

## 5. Initialize the Genesis Block
The `synnergy` CLI exposes a `genesis` module for bootstrapping the ledger. Adjust `configs/genesis.json` to set the chain ID, genesis timestamp and treasury wallets:
```bash
./synnergy genesis show                 # display default wallet allocations
./synnergy genesis allocate 1000000000  # compute distribution for initial supply
./synnergy genesis init                 # commit the first block and return stats
```
Genesis addresses include allocations for development, charity, authority nodes and validators. The call to `InitGenesis` returns block height and circulating supply information for auditability.

## 6. Start Network Services
With configuration and genesis complete, launch the base node and peer‑to‑peer layer:
```bash
export SYN_CONFIG=configs/dev.yaml
./synnergy network start             # initialise gossip and RPC servers
./synnergy basenode start            # run core services on the current machine
./synnergy network peers             # verify connectivity
```
The base node listens on the `server.host` and `server.port` defined in `configs/<env>.yaml` and exposes a gRPC/REST control plane alongside the gossip layer.  Internally, `core.NewNode` assembles several subsystems:
- `Ledger` for balances and transaction application
- `SynnergyConsensus` for validator selection and block production
- `SNVM` virtual machine for smart‑contract execution
- `Firewall` and `SystemHealthLogger` for defensive monitoring
- Mempool and blockchain arrays for pending and committed state

To engage specialised roles use dedicated commands:
```bash
./synnergy mining start              # activate `core.NewMiningNode`
./synnergy staking_node start        # begin staking service
./synnergy watchtower start          # launch network guardian
./synnergy regulatory_node start     # enable compliance hooks
```
Startup wrappers such as `scripts/startup.sh`, `scripts/node_setup.sh` and `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh` configure environment variables, generate certificates and launch processes.  Consensus administration utilities — `scripts/consensus_start.sh`, `scripts/consensus_validator_manage.sh`, `scripts/consensus_recovery.sh` and `scripts/consensus_finality_check.sh` — manage validator elections, recover stalled rounds and verify finality proofs.  Each wrapper constructs the corresponding node type (e.g., `core.NewWatchtowerNode`) on top of the base infrastructure.

## 7. Manage Validators and Stake
Validator participation is controlled through the `ValidatorNode` composition in `core/validator_node.go` which wraps `ValidatorManager` and `QuorumTracker` components. Typical lifecycle:
```bash
./synnergy staking_node stake <addr> <amount>   # register stake
./synnergy validator add <addr> <stake>         # join validator set
./synnergy validator remove <addr>              # exit and release stake
```
Quorum thresholds, slashing and rehabilitation are handled automatically by the node using `SlashValidator`, `ReportDowntime` and related routines. The `scripts/stake_penalty.sh` helper can simulate infractions to verify slashing rules.

## 8. Key Management and Wallet Operations
Wallet creation and identity attestation are handled by `core/wallet.go` and `idwallet_registration.go`. Use the CLI to generate and register wallets:
```bash
./synnergy wallet new --out mywallet.json --password <passphrase>
./synnergy idwallet register <address> '<metadata>'
./synnergy idwallet check <address>
```
Operational scripts such as `scripts/wallet_init.sh`, `scripts/wallet_key_rotation.sh`, `scripts/wallet_multisig_setup.sh` and `scripts/wallet_offline_sign.sh` automate provisioning, key rotation, multisignature coordination and offline signing. For regulated environments `scripts/idwallet_register.sh` captures KYC data and ties wallets to verified identities.

## 9. Deploy Smart Contracts
The runtime embeds a virtual machine (`core.NewSNVM`) and contract registry (`core.NewContractRegistry`). Contracts reside under `smart-contracts/` (WebAssembly templates) and `smart-contracts/solidity/` (reference Solidity implementations).  Typical lifecycle:
```bash
./synnergy contracts compile <src.wasm> --out build/          # compile contract
./synnergy contracts deploy build/src.wasm --from <addr>      # deploy to chain
./synnergy contracts invoke <addr> <method> [args]            # execute entrypoint
./synnergy contracts query <addr> <state-key>                 # read contract state
```
Gas usage is deterministically priced through `synnergy.LoadGasTable()` and `synnergy.RegisterGasCost()` calls executed during start‑up.  Pre‑deployment checks are orchestrated via:

- `scripts/contract_static_analysis.sh` – run `gosec` and `wasm-verify` across sources
- `scripts/contract_language_compatibility_test.sh` – ensure cross‑language parity with Solidity templates
- `scripts/contract_coverage_report.sh` – generate execution coverage from `tests/contracts/`
- `scripts/deploy_contract.sh` and `scripts/deploy_starter_smart_contracts_to_blockchain.sh` – push artefacts to a node
- `scripts/upgrade_contract.sh` – perform in‑place upgrades using proxy patterns

These utilities validate bytecode, enforce deterministic gas schedules and document deployments for audit trails.

## 10. Cross‑Chain Interoperability
Bridging, connection management and relay functionality live in `core/cross_chain.go`, `cross_chain_bridge.go`, `cross_chain_connection.go` and supporting types. The CLI exposes these capabilities via dedicated commands:
```bash
# register and inspect bridges
./synnergy cross_chain register <source> <target> <relayer>
./synnergy cross_chain list --json
./synnergy cross_chain authorize <bridge_id> <relayer>

# manage connections and asset transfers
./synnergy cross_chain_connection open <local> <remote>
./synnergy cross_chain_bridge deposit <bridge_id> <from> <to> <amount>
./synnergy cross_chain_bridge claim <transfer_id> <proof>
```
Scripts including `scripts/cross_chain_setup.sh`, `scripts/cross_chain_bridge.sh`, `scripts/cross_chain_connection.sh` and `scripts/cross_chain_transactions.sh` orchestrate channel creation, relayer whitelisting and transfer proofs for production environments.

## 11. High Availability and Monitoring
Resilient deployments combine active‑active replicas with watchtower oversight. Scripts within `scripts/` facilitate cluster management:
```bash
scripts/high_availability_setup.sh
scripts/ha_failover_test.sh
scripts/metrics_export.sh
scripts/metrics_alert_dispatch.sh
```
Operational telemetry is available through:
```bash
./synnergy system_health snapshot    # one‑off metrics
./synnergy system_health log         # stream structured logs
```
The node initialises a no‑op OpenTelemetry tracer (`otel.SetTracerProvider`) allowing integration with external collectors when desired.

## 12. Production Deployment Options
**Docker Compose**
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
Builds the `synnergy` image and launches an example node.

**Kubernetes (Helm)**
```bash
helm install synnergy deploy/helm/synnergy
```
Use values overrides to specify image tags, replicas and resource limits.

**Terraform & Ansible**
```bash
cd deploy/terraform
terraform init && terraform apply -var 'ami_id=ami-123456'
ansible-playbook -i <inventory> deploy/ansible/playbook.yml
```
These templates provision infrastructure, configure nodes and enforce hardened defaults.

## 13. Security & Compliance
Run static analysis and vulnerability checks prior to production rollout:
```bash
make security          # staticcheck, gosec, govulncheck
scripts/pki_setup.sh   # generate CA and node certificates
scripts/aml_kyc_process.sh
scripts/firewall_setup.sh
scripts/compliance_audit.sh
```
Core services such as `firewall.go`, `access_control.go`, `anomaly_detection.go`, `ai_secure_storage.go` and `identity_verification.go` can be enabled to harden the runtime against unauthorised access and data leakage. `scripts/multi_factor_setup.sh` provisions multi‑factor authentication, while `scripts/ai_drift_monitor.sh` and `scripts/ai_privacy_preservation.sh` enforce model integrity and data minimisation for AI components.

Additional modules cover biometric authentication (`core.NewBiometricService`), zero‑trust channels (`core.NewZeroTrustEngine`) and regulatory reporting (`core.NewRegulatoryNode`).


## 14. Node Roles and Specialised Services
Synnergy supports a broad spectrum of node roles so organisations can tailor deployments to regulatory, analytical and operational needs. Each role extends the base ledger, consensus and virtual-machine stack while remaining interoperable on the common P2P layer. Setup scripts initialise keys, configuration and health checks.

**Core Infrastructure**
- **Base Node (`core/base_node.go`)** – fundamental networking and ledger services; initialise with `scripts/node_setup.sh` or `scripts/full_node_setup.sh`.
