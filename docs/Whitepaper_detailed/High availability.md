# High Availability

## Introduction
Neto Solaris's Synnergy Network is engineered to deliver continuous service even under adverse conditions. High availability is achieved through a combination of distributed architecture, automated failover, proactive monitoring, and operational best practices that keep mission‑critical services online.

## Architectural Principles for Resilience
- **Distributed ledger replication** ensures every authority node maintains a full copy of the blockchain, eliminating single points of failure and enabling rapid recovery.
- **Geographically diverse deployment** spreads nodes across availability zones and regions, reducing the impact of localized outages.
- **Stateless node design** allows quick provisioning or replacement of nodes without complex recovery procedures.

## Automated Failover Management
Synnergy incorporates a heartbeat‑driven failover controller that tracks active nodes and promotes backups when the primary becomes unresponsive. The `FailoverManager` records the last heartbeat of each node and elects the most recent backup as the new primary if the current leader exceeds its timeout window【F:core/high_availability.go†L8-L69】. This automated promotion minimizes service interruption and removes the need for manual intervention during node failures.

## Command Line Orchestration
Operators can manage high availability directly from the Synnergy CLI. The `highavailability` command suite initializes the failover manager, registers backup nodes, records heartbeats, and reports the active primary node, enabling seamless integration with scripts and orchestration tools【F:cli/high_availability.go†L15-L73】.

## Health Monitoring and Telemetry
To sustain availability over time, nodes expose runtime metrics through the `SystemHealthLogger`. This component captures CPU usage, memory allocation, peer counts, and block height, storing the latest snapshot for downstream monitoring services and the Watchtower node network【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】. Continuous telemetry empowers operators to detect anomalies early and trigger preventative maintenance before they impact uptime.

## Watchtower Oversight and Network Security
Dedicated Watchtower nodes survey the chain for integrity issues while enforcing ingress rules through an embedded firewall. Each watchtower periodically collects health metrics and reports detected forks, giving operators a real‑time view of node performance and potential consensus divergences【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】. Its lightweight `Firewall` blocks malicious addresses, tokens, or IPs, preserving bandwidth and shielding critical services from denial‑of‑service attacks【F:firewall.go†L5-L90】.

## Data Replication and Query Layer
High availability extends beyond consensus to content and query distribution. `ContentNetworkNode` instances register the assets they host so peers can quickly discover alternate sources when a node becomes unreachable【F:content_node.go†L5-L48】. For read‑heavy workloads, `IndexingNode` maintains in‑memory key/value indexes that serve low‑latency queries without stressing primary ledger services【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L56】.

## Anomaly Detection and Predictive Maintenance
Proactive analytics complement raw telemetry. The streaming `AnomalyDetector` calculates rolling mean and variance scores, flagging outliers that may foreshadow resource exhaustion or attack patterns before service is disrupted【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. Integrating these insights with Watchtower alerts enables automated remediation workflows and escalation policies suitable for enterprise SLAs.

## Resilience Testing
High availability logic is validated through unit tests that simulate node failures. `TestFailoverManager` forces a primary node to miss heartbeats and verifies that backups seamlessly assume leadership, ensuring the promotion algorithm works under adverse conditions【F:high_availability_test.go†L8-L21】. These tests provide a baseline for more advanced chaos engineering drills in production.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Strategy
Rolling upgrades keep the network secure without disrupting service. Administrators can introduce backup nodes, allow them to sync, and then gracefully drain traffic from primaries during maintenance windows. Combined with the failover manager, this strategy maintains quorum while applying patches or configuration changes.

## Operational Best Practices
- Deploy multiple authority and watchtower nodes per region to absorb infrastructure failures.
- Use diverse cloud providers or on‑premise data centers to avoid correlated outages.
- Automate heartbeat emission and health checks through the CLI or orchestration platform.
- Regularly review telemetry dashboards and alerting rules to validate system health.
- Periodically execute failover and disaster‑recovery drills to validate runbooks and tooling.
- Incorporate anomaly thresholds into alerting pipelines so operators can intervene before SLAs are breached.

## Stage 78 Enterprise Enhancements
- **Centralised availability telemetry:** `core.NewEnterpriseOrchestrator` reports VM, consensus, wallet and authority readiness via `synnergy orchestrator status` and web APIs, giving SRE teams a single feed for uptime dashboards and incident management.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L21-L166】【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L6-L75】【F:web/pages/api/orchestrator.js†L1-L23】
- **Predictable remediation costs:** Stage 78 gas documentation covers orchestrator-led authority elections, audits and wallet sealing, ensuring failover workflows carry deterministic resource budgets across CLI, VM and browser tooling.【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L420-L424】
- **Resilience validation:** Unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world orchestrator tests simulate failover, consensus rebalancing and cross-chain recovery, reinforcing Synnergy’s high-availability guarantees under enterprise load.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L5-L75】【F:cli/orchestrator_test.go†L5-L26】

## Conclusion
Through deliberate architecture and automated operations, Neto Solaris ensures the Synnergy Network remains resilient, self‑healing, and available around the clock. High availability is not a single feature but an ecosystem of practices that safeguard the continuity of decentralized services.
