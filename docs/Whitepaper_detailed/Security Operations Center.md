# Security Operations Center

Blackridge Group Ltd's Security Operations Center (SOC) is the defensive nerve center of the Synnergy Network. It delivers continuous situational awareness by collecting telemetry from every node role, correlating anomalies with on‑chain activity and guiding operators through a hardened dashboard. The SOC is engineered to meet enterprise security, compliance and availability requirements while remaining lightweight enough for rapid deployment across diverse infrastructures.

## Strategic Objectives
- **Unified visibility** – aggregate logs, metrics and alerts from mining, staking, authority, watchtower and warfare nodes into a single operational view.
- **Real‑time threat detection** – surface suspicious patterns using pluggable analytics engines and correlate events with ledger state for precise impact analysis.
- **Rapid incident response** – enable administrators to trigger playbooks or automated mitigations through a CLI‑backed web interface.
- **Regulatory assurance** – preserve tamper‑evident audit trails and support fine‑grained access controls to satisfy internal and external compliance mandates.

## Architecture Overview
The SOC is implemented as a TypeScript service that loads runtime settings from `config/production.ts` and merges them with environment variables for flexible deployment【F:GUI/security-operations-center/config/production.ts†L1-L4】. The entry point in `src/main.ts` performs fault‑tolerant startup and emits a clear status message or exits with a non‑zero code on failure【F:GUI/security-operations-center/src/main.ts†L4-L15】.

Key components include:
- **Configuration layer** – environment‑driven parameters such as `API_URL` and log level provide consistent behavior across development, Docker and Kubernetes targets.
- **Service layer** – API wrappers under `src/services` manage resilient REST calls to Synnergy nodes through the function web, exposing hooks for dashboard widgets and automation.
- **Presentation layer** – `src/components` hosts React/Vue components (planned) that render alerts, metrics and remediation actions in the browser.
- **Testing harness** – Jest‑based unit and end‑to‑end suites verify startup behavior and API integration, ensuring reliable deployments.

## Telemetry Sources and Data Flow
The SOC ingests data from multiple runtime components to build a consolidated security picture:
- **Watchtower nodes** collect system health metrics every ten seconds, capturing CPU usage, memory consumption and peer counts for correlation【F:watchtower_node.go†L53-L63】【F:system_health_logging.go†L23-L35】.
- **Firewall rules** aggregate blocked wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs, allowing the SOC to surface policy violations and push real‑time updates to node defenses【F:firewall.go†L5-L12】【F:firewall.go†L90-L104】.
- **Node logs and ledger events** stream through the function web, letting the SOC align infrastructure telemetry with on‑chain activity for forensic accuracy.
- **Metric snapshots** – in-memory health snapshots expose CPU, memory, peer counts and block height without disk I/O, enabling responsive dashboards and minimal storage overhead【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L48】.

## Data Ingestion and Analytics
1. **Log and metric collection** – nodes publish structured events (transactions, consensus state, validator health) to the function web where the SOC retrieves them via authenticated REST endpoints.
2. **Normalization** – incoming records are standardised and timestamped before entering the analysis pipeline.
3. **Threat correlation** – pluggable rules engines and AI modules (e.g., anomaly detection and drift monitoring) highlight deviations, enabling early detection of exploits or misconfigurations.
4. **Alert dissemination** – actionable findings are broadcast to operators through the GUI and can be forwarded to external SIEM or ticketing systems.

## Advanced Analytics and Automation
- **Statistical anomaly detection** – streaming mean/variance calculations flag abnormal metrics, letting the SOC spot outliers without storing raw histories【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.
- **Model-drift monitoring** – baseline comparisons highlight when AI model performance deviates beyond an operator-defined threshold, prompting retraining or rollback【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L34】.
- **Automated policy propagation** – detector outputs can trigger immediate firewall rule updates to quarantine suspicious accounts or peers.

## Alerting and Response
- **Interactive playbooks** – operators can initiate predefined mitigation scripts or invoke CLI commands directly from the dashboard to quarantine nodes or rotate credentials.
- **Automated enforcement** – firewall updates and rate limiting policies propagate immediately across participating nodes, minimizing manual intervention.
- **Test coverage** – unit and end‑to‑end tests ensure the startup routine honors environment variables and emits clear status messages before alerts are raised【F:GUI/security-operations-center/tests/unit/example.test.ts†L1-L10】【F:GUI/security-operations-center/tests/e2e/example.e2e.test.ts†L1-L10】.

## Identity Assurance and Secure Channels
- **Biometric access controls** – privileged actions may require biometric validation through nodes that only execute tasks after successful template verification【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L50】【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】.
- **Zero‑trust data channels** – encrypted channels backed by ed25519 signatures ensure that telemetry and response commands cannot be intercepted or forged during transit【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L114】.

## Deployment and Configuration
The module ships with straightforward operational commands:
- **Local execution** – `npm install` then `npm run build && node dist/main.js` starts the service with defaults【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L7-L13】.
- **Docker** – `docker compose up --build` encapsulates the SOC with its dependencies for repeatable environments【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L15-L18】.
- **Kubernetes** – manifests in `k8s/` enable cluster deployment via `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml`【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L20-L25】.
- **Testing** – `npm test` runs Jest suites to validate configuration parsing and startup output【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L27-L31】.

Container artifacts support reproducible builds and high availability:
- A multi‑stage Dockerfile compiles sources and produces a minimal runtime image run as an unprivileged user【F:GUI/security-operations-center/Dockerfile†L1-L16】.
- `docker-compose.yml` exposes port `3000` and injects the API URL via environment variables for local orchestration【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docker-compose.yml†L1-L10】.
- The Kubernetes deployment defaults to two replicas and configures the internal API endpoint through a dedicated `API_URL` variable, enabling horizontal scaling across clusters【F:GUI/security-operations-center/k8s/deployment.yaml†L1-L22】.

## Infrastructure Automation
- **Helm chart** – a reusable chart packages the SOC for declarative Kubernetes rollouts alongside other network components【F:deploy/helm/synnergy/Chart.yaml†L1-L16】.
- **Terraform stack** – infrastructure as code provisions VPCs, subnets and auto‑scaling groups, embedding security groups for node communications【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L52】【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L42-L62】.

## Integration with the Synnergy Network
- **Function web coupling** – the SOC communicates with nodes, authority services and wallets through the Synnergy function web, allowing dashboards to query status and invoke mitigations through the same interfaces used by other modules【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/synnergy_network_function_web.md†L29-L33】.
- **Authentication** – API tokens issued by the wallet service guard every request, ensuring only authorised operators can retrieve telemetry or trigger actions.
- **CLI synergy** – core Synnergy CLIs expose JSON responses that the SOC consumes for visualization, while operators can escalate from GUI alerts directly to scripted CLI remediation.

## Enterprise Security and Compliance
- **Secrets management** – environment variables and configuration files are the sole carriers of credentials, allowing integration with vault technologies during deployment.
- **Role-based access control** – the firewall and API layers restrict sensitive functions to authorised roles, aligning with zero‑trust principles.
- **Compliance posture** – immutable audit logs and policy-driven block lists provide verifiable evidence for regulatory audits and incident response.
- **Regulatory rule evaluation** – the RegulatoryManager enforces jurisdiction-specific limits and flags transactions exceeding configured thresholds【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】.
- **Address oversight** – the ComplianceManager suspends or whitelists accounts and blocks transactions involving sanctioned parties【F:compliance_management.go†L15-L78】.

## Operations and Governance
- **Access control** – role‑based permissions restrict sensitive dashboards and response actions to designated teams.
- **Audit logging** – immutable records of operator activity and system events support forensic investigations and compliance reporting.
- **Availability** – the SOC is stateless by design, enabling horizontal scaling and blue‑green deployments with zero downtime.
