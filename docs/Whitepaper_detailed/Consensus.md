# Consensus

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. integrates a multi-algorithm consensus engine within the Synnergy Network to balance security, scalability, and decentralization. The platform combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Proof-of-History (PoH) to dynamically adapt to real‑time network conditions while retaining deterministic settlement and auditability.

## Hybrid Consensus Engine
SynnergyConsensus assigns proportional weights to PoW, PoS, and PoH. These weights are normalized and never drop below a minimum floor unless a mechanism is unavailable, allowing the chain to emphasize the most effective algorithm under varying demand and stake distributions【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L88】.

### Adaptive Weighting
An AdaptiveManager continuously tunes the weights using live metrics such as transaction demand and stake concentration. Adjustments remain thread-safe and expose the updated weighting matrix for external monitoring tools【F:core/consensus_adaptive_management.go†L5-L26】. The core engine decomposes the transition threshold into load, security and stake components before combining them, allowing operators to reason about which factor triggered a shift in weights【F:core/consensus.go†L91-L119】.

### Threshold and Control Flags
Fine-grained threshold functions compute the individual contributions of network load, adversarial pressure, and stake concentration before forming a composite value that determines whether rebalancing is required【F:core/consensus.go†L91-L119】. Administrators can disable PoW, PoS, or PoH or suspend PoW rewards in real time; the engine renormalizes the remaining weights automatically through availability and reward toggles【F:core/consensus.go†L71-L88】【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】.

### Difficulty Management
A dedicated DifficultyManager maintains PoW difficulty using a sliding window of recent block times. Each new sample recalculates the target difficulty to keep block production stable despite changes in hash power【F:core/consensus_difficulty.go†L5-L42】.

### Mining and Sub-Block Validation
Sub-blocks encapsulate a validator’s ordered transactions, a Proof‑of‑History hash, and a signature, creating deterministic segments before block assembly【F:core/block.go†L10-L41】. During mining, a node selects a validator based on stake, packages its mempool into a sub-block, validates the signature, finalizes the block with a BFT vote and aggregates the result into a candidate block【F:core/node.go†L59-L78】. SynnergyConsensus then verifies the sub-block and performs a SHA‑256 Proof‑of‑Work search to finalize the block, embedding the sub-block’s hash in the header to prove work and prevent tampering【F:core/consensus.go†L197-L214】.

## Genesis Bootstrapping
Initialization begins with a Genesis block mined by the active consensus engine. `InitGenesis` credits the creator wallet, mines the first block and records the initial consensus weights, returning a summary of circulating supply and block hash for audit purposes【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】.

## Dynamic Mode Switching
Synnergy supports dynamic mode evaluation through a ConsensusSwitcher that selects the dominant algorithm based on current weights【F:core/consensus_specific.go†L15-L45】. For fast reconfiguration, a ConsensusHopper evaluates runtime metrics—transactions per second, latency, and validator count—to jump between PoW, PoS, and PoH without manual intervention【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L70】.

### Consensus-Specific Nodes
Operators can deploy nodes locked to a single algorithm. A ConsensusSpecificNode configures its internal engine so that only the designated mode is available and fully weighted, enabling specialized infrastructure such as dedicated PoW miners or PoS validators【F:core/consensus_specific_node.go†L3-L30】.

## Validator Lifecycle and Governance
ValidatorManager tracks stake levels, eligibility, and slashing status. It enforces minimum staking thresholds, supports stake reductions for misbehaviour, and exposes an eligible set for deterministic validator selection【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L11-L92】. The engine uses a VRF-style hash over the previous block hash and validator address, yielding a consistent winner across nodes without central coordination【F:core/consensus.go†L150-L185】. Validator operations—add, remove, slash and eligibility queries—are available through CLI commands for real‑time governance【F:cli/validator_management.go†L21-L89】.
Finalized blocks trigger stake rewards for the validators whose sub-blocks were included, incentivizing honest participation alongside slashing penalties.

## Cross-Consensus Networks
To interoperate with external systems, the ConsensusNetworkManager records connections between heterogeneous consensus environments. Networks can be registered, listed, or removed, allowing controlled scaling across differing algorithms and domains【F:core/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L8-L68】. Operators manage these links via CLI to register new networks, inspect existing ones or remove obsolete connections【F:cli/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L13-L109】.

## Operational Tooling
The ConsensusService runs the mining loop asynchronously, exposing start, stop, and info endpoints for integration with orchestration layers【F:core/consensus_start.go†L11-L61】. The `consensus` command suite supports block mining, weight inspection, on-demand adjustments, threshold and transition calculations, difficulty tuning, validator availability toggling, and PoW reward controls from a single interface【F:cli/consensus.go†L14-L180】. Dedicated utilities provide adaptive weight management, difficulty sampling, explicit mode evaluation, and construction of single-mode nodes for specialised deployments【F:cli/consensus_adaptive_management.go†L11-L70】【F:cli/consensus_difficulty.go†L11-L66】【F:cli/consensus_mode.go†L11-L63】【F:cli/consensus_specific_node.go†L13-L76】【F:cli/consensus_service.go†L12-L52】.

## Transaction Finality and Throughput
### Sub-Block Finality
Each sub-block's hash and validator signature create an immutable commitment to its transactions. A BFT voting round then finalizes the block once two thirds of validators sign off, marking the block as irreversible before it is sealed with PoW【F:core/consensus.go†L216-L232】【F:core/node.go†L63-L78】.

### Dynamic Capacity
The ConsensusHopper monitors network throughput, latency, and validator count to select the most efficient algorithm at runtime. High TPS with low latency favours PoS, few validators trigger PoH scheduling, and PoW secures the chain otherwise, letting the network scale capacity without bottlenecking transaction flow【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L22】【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L68】.

## Configuration and Telemetry
Default parameters are provisioned through network configuration files, defining baseline block times, initial weights, and availability flags so new deployments start from a predictable consensus posture【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L28】. The runtime service instruments its mining loop with the internal telemetry tracer, allowing operators to observe execution spans and block height reporting for proactive monitoring【F:core/consensus_start.go†L23-L44】.

## Security and Resilience
Availability flags let operators disable algorithms or pause PoW rewards to mitigate attacks or conserve resources, after which weights are renormalized automatically【F:core/consensus.go†L71-L88】【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】. Sub-block validation ensures only signed and populated segments are accepted into a block, providing a lightweight integrity check across PoS and PoH rounds【F:core/consensus.go†L187-L195】. Slashing now records evidence of misbehaviour, enabling network-wide enforcement of penalties【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L54-L92】.
The sequential combination of signed sub-blocks and PoW finalization means an attacker must both forge a validator signature and outpace network hash power to rewrite history, significantly raising the cost of compromise【F:core/block.go†L19-L41】【F:core/consensus.go†L197-L214】.

## Conclusion
By fusing three consensus algorithms with adaptive weighting, validator governance, and extensive tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a resilient and configurable foundation for the Synnergy Network. The architecture accommodates evolving network dynamics while preserving auditable security guarantees.
