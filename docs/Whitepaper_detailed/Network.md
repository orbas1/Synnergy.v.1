# Network

## Overview
Neto Solaris operates the Synnergy Network, an extensible blockchain infrastructure where heterogeneous nodes exchange data through a biometric‑aware communication layer. The network service manages peer discovery, transaction routing and a lightweight pub‑sub bus while providing life‑cycle controls to other components and the command line.

Stage 79 integrates orchestration so network services can be bootstrapped with replication, authority registration and consensus diagnostics in a single command. Executing `synnergy orchestrator bootstrap --node-id control-plane --consensus Synnergy-PBFT --replicate` runs `core.EnterpriseOrchestrator.BootstrapNetwork`, emitting a signed bootstrap signature and reporting VM status, consensus networks, authority counts and replication activity for operational review.【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L58-L117】【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L71-L209】 Startup synchronises Stage 79 gas metadata, and the control panel mirrors this workflow so CLI automation, dashboards and browser tooling remain aligned on pricing and readiness across maintenance windows or scaling events.【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L63-L106】【F:web/pages/index.js†L1-L214】【F:web/pages/api/bootstrap.js†L1-L45】 Bootstrap tests spanning unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world cases ensure the network retains strong encryption, privacy and regulatory compliance under enterprise workloads.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L73-L178】

## Architecture
The `Network` struct coordinates standard nodes and relay nodes. It maintains a broadcast queue, biometric authentication service and subscriber registry, launching a background processing loop on creation so that transaction propagation begins immediately.

### Asynchronous Propagation
Transactions are first enqueued and then fanned out to every known peer. `Broadcast` attaches biometric credentials before queuing, ensuring that only authorised traffic is relayed. The processing loop pulls from the queue and distributes transactions across nodes and relays. This design decouples submission from propagation, enabling high throughput without blocking callers.

### Pub‑Sub Messaging
Beyond transaction flow, the network exposes topic‑based messaging. Subscribers receive independent buffered channels and publishers can disseminate arbitrary payloads on a best‑effort basis. These hooks underpin real‑time telemetry and cross‑module communication.

### Lifecycle Management
`Start` spins up background workers, allocates the broadcast queue and begins processing immediately, while `Stop` gracefully drains outstanding transactions before releasing resources. These controls allow orchestration tools and the CLI to restart networking services without node restarts.

### Relay Coordination
Relay nodes extend propagation beyond directly connected peers. The network tracks relays separately, fanning transactions to them in the same loop used for standard nodes so that geographically distributed segments remain synchronised even under partitioned conditions.

### Adaptive Consensus
The network samples throughput, latency and validator participation to dynamically select the most appropriate consensus model. A consensus hopper evaluates these metrics and pivots between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake or proof‑of‑history modes so that the system maintains performance as conditions change.

## Node Ecosystem
### Core Nodes
Every node maintains a ledger, consensus engine, virtual machine and mempool while tracking stakes and slashing status for governance. They expose transaction queues and peer lists so that validators, clients and auxiliary services interact through a uniform interface.

### Content Nodes
Content network nodes advertise which digital assets they host, allowing participants to discover resources through a simple registry and to add or remove items as availability changes. This lightweight catalogue supports decentralised storage and content distribution without central servers.

### Indexing Nodes
Indexing nodes build in‑memory key/value indices to accelerate queries against ledger data. They support insert, query, delete and enumeration operations for rapid look‑ups, enabling analytics services to scan large block ranges without replaying the entire chain.

### Mining Nodes
Lightweight mining nodes simulate proof‑of‑work by generating block candidates at a configurable hash rate and submitting mined blocks back to the network. The abstraction is intentionally simple so that testnets and development environments can exercise block production without specialised hardware.

### Regulatory Nodes
Regulatory nodes evaluate transactions against registered rules, flagging entities when violations occur and maintaining auditable logs for compliance reviews. Each node records the reason for every flag, building a tamper‑evident trail for regulators and auditors.

### Watchtower Nodes
Watchtower nodes monitor system health and detect forks. They collect metrics, run firewall checks and report anomalies to operators. Background routines emit periodic snapshots that external dashboards or alerting systems can consume.

### Staking Nodes
Staking nodes track token commitments from participants, expose balances and aggregate totals for reward calculations. They support stake and unstake operations without requiring a full ledger implementation and can be embedded into wallets or lightweight clients.

### Energy‑Efficient Nodes
Energy‑efficient nodes record transaction volume against electricity usage, issue sustainability certificates and monitor whether validators fall below configured efficiency thresholds. Certificates capture transactions per kilowatt‑hour and accumulated carbon offsets, allowing validators to demonstrate sustainable operations.

### Environmental Monitoring Nodes
Environmental monitoring nodes ingest sensor data and trigger programmable conditions, enabling on‑chain actions when external environmental thresholds are met. Conditions describe operators, thresholds and sensor identifiers so that policy logic can be adjusted without redeploying code.

### Geospatial Nodes
Geospatial nodes collect location records for subjects, building immutable histories of movement that other services can query for audits or asset tracking. Each record stores coordinates with a trusted timestamp to ensure evidentiary integrity.

## Network Management Interface
A dedicated CLI command suite starts or stops services, lists peers and exposes simple publish/subscribe helpers. Operators can broadcast messages or tail topics directly from the terminal for diagnostics and orchestration tasks, and ancillary commands surface address parsing, gas snapshot retrieval and other utilities so that all operational workflows are scriptable.

## Testing Harness
Stage 46 introduces an end‑to‑end harness that launches the wallet server, builds an in‑memory network with biometric authentication, creates wallets via HTTP and verifies transaction propagation across nodes. The harness also exercises CLI functionality such as address parsing and gas snapshot retrieval to ensure seamless component interoperability and to validate that consensus hopping and pub‑sub channels behave as expected under load.

## Security
Biometric verification is woven into the broadcast path, preventing unauthorised transactions from entering the network. Watchtower nodes log fork events and performance metrics, while regulatory nodes enforce jurisdictional policies, giving infrastructure operators visibility and control.

### Firewall Enforcement
An embedded firewall maintains block lists for wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs. Rules can be added or revoked at runtime, letting operators react to abuse without downtime.

### Zero‑Trust Channels
Zero‑trust data channels encrypt payloads with per‑channel keys and sign each cipher text using Ed25519 keys. Messages are stored as signed envelopes and are verified and decrypted on receipt, assuring confidentiality and provenance for inter‑service communication.

### Monitoring and Health Logging
A lightweight health logger records memory usage, peer counts and block height alongside a timestamp. Metrics are periodically emitted to watchtower nodes, allowing dashboards or external systems to consume near real‑time telemetry for capacity planning and incident response.

## Compliance and Governance
Regulatory nodes integrate with a configurable rule engine that validates transactions before they propagate. Flagged entities are recorded with reasons, forming an immutable audit log. Governance policies can be adjusted by updating rule definitions, enabling jurisdictions to enforce local requirements without altering core consensus.

## Scalability and Interoperability
Relay nodes extend propagation and redundancy, and the pub‑sub layer supports auxiliary protocols. A consensus hopper scales throughput by shifting consensus modes when network conditions fluctuate. Cross‑chain managers maintain long‑lived links to external ledgers and assign deterministic bridge identifiers, while bridge managers coordinate token transfers with verifiable proofs and authorized relayers, positioning the platform for heterogeneous blockchain domains.

## Stage 79 Enhancements
- **Unified bootstrap for networking stacks.** Stage 79’s runtime brings the VM, ledger, consensus fabric, wallet and supporting registries online together, letting CLI commands and automation scripts manage peer lifecycles and failover from a single, fault-tolerant context【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap.go†L17-L142】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L18-L55】.
- **Ledger replication and attestation flows.** Newly catalogued opcodes and gas entries—covering replication streams, primary elections, privacy envelopes and node attestations—equip operators to script disaster recovery, validator rotation and telemetry validation with predictable fees across CLI and API integrations【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L240-L404】【F:docs/reference/opcodes_list.md†L685-L688】【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L820-L839】.
- **Manifest-powered network console.** The CLI manifest exporter feeds the React control panel so network engineers can explore commands, inspect required flags, and execute dry runs from a hardened browser workflow, all backed by automated tests that guard manifest stability【F:cli/gui_manifest.go†L20-L118】【F:web/pages/api/commands.js†L1-L29】【F:web/pages/api/run.js†L1-L21】【F:web/pages/index.js†L87-L200】【F:cli/gui_cmd_test.go†L11-L82】.
- **Gas catalogue verification.** Bootstrap tests assert that networking and governance opcodes remain priced before services start, preventing peers from launching without the deterministic gas guarantees that underpin Stage 79’s enterprise commitments【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap_test.go†L10-L41】【F:gas_table.go†L20-L167】.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network by Neto Solaris combines secure transaction routing, flexible messaging and a diverse node ecosystem to provide a resilient foundation for distributed applications. Its automated testing harness and CLI tooling streamline operations, while specialised nodes offer governance, compliance and monitoring capabilities for enterprise‑grade deployments.
