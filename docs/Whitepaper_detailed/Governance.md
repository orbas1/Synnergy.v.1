# Governance

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs Synnergy Network governance as a layered system that blends on‑chain transparency with off‑chain accountability. Authority nodes, token holders and automated services cooperate through audited smart‑contract logic to steer protocol evolution while preserving security and regulatory compliance.

## Governance Architecture
- **Authority Nodes** – regulated entities that validate proposals and execute approved changes. They operate dedicated tooling and are subject to continuous monitoring. The core `AuthorityNodeRegistry` catalogs addresses, assigns roles, records votes and can sample a weighted electorate for committee formation【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L12-L95】.
- **Token‑Weighted Voting** – community participants wield governance tokens to propose upgrades, delegate voting power and ratify decisions.
- **Modular Services** – audit logging, replay protection and weight registries are implemented as isolated modules that can be composed into higher‑level governance applications.
- **Authenticated Membership** – the `dao-members` CLI validates ECDSA signatures and emits JSON when modifying roles, enabling auditable access control.

## Governance Tokens
### SYN300 – Proposal and Voting Engine
The SYN300 governance token exposes delegation, proposal management and quorum‑based execution. Holders may delegate or revoke voting rights, query effective voting power, register proposals and cast approvals or rejections. Proposals can be inspected or listed for external review, and finalisation is gated behind explicit quorum checks that aggregate delegated balances, ensuring accountable decision making【F:core/syn300_token.go†L43-L134】.

### SYN3600 – Weight Ledger
SYN3600 maintains a lightweight ledger of voting weights. Administrators assign and query address weights, enabling bespoke governance models such as council memberships or tiered franchises and providing a primitive for off‑chain registries to synchronise with on‑chain voting weight【F:internal/tokens/syn3600.go†L5-L27】.

### Staking Node – Governance Locking
`StakingNode` locks and releases tokens for governance or validation, tracking individual balances and the network’s total stake so quorum thresholds and eligibility rules can reference verifiable on‑chain tallies【F:core/staking_node.go†L5-L52】.

## Authority Node Registry
Authority nodes are catalogued in a registry that supports add, remove, get and list operations. Each record stores the node’s address, assigned role and a map of votes cast by participants, allowing regulators to audit decision provenance and rotate participants with minimal overhead【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L34-L128】.

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Delegation** – token holders optionally delegate voting power to trusted representatives.
2. **Submission** – a proposer registers a new governance proposal with descriptive metadata.
3. **Voting** – participants cast approvals or rejections; delegated balances are automatically counted.
4. **Execution** – when the approval voting power exceeds the configured quorum, proposals are finalised and enacted.

CLI tooling streamlines these steps. `governance_setup.sh` invokes the network binary with a proposal title and body file, while a lightweight wrapper `governance_propose.sh` offers quick submissions from development environments【F:scripts/governance_setup.sh†L1-L12】【F:cmd/scripts/governance_propose.sh†L1-L5】.

## Governance Contracts
Synnergy Network distributes governance contract templates to anchor decision making directly on-chain. The Solidity-based `DaoGovernance` contract defines a proposal struct with vote counts, execution flag and deadline, allowing stakeholders to create proposals, cast votes and finalise outcomes after review【F:smart-contracts/solidity/DaoGovernance.sol†L4-L40】. A Rust/Wasm implementation mirrors these semantics for chains that favour WebAssembly runtimes, exposing the same creation, voting and execution interfaces for cross-platform parity【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/dao_governance.rs†L1-L44】.

## Timed Governance
Each proposal carries an explicit expiry. When a proposal is created, the contract sets its deadline to the current block timestamp plus a caller-supplied duration, ensuring votes are accepted only within the authorised window and execution occurs solely after the deadline has elapsed【F:smart-contracts/solidity/DaoGovernance.sol†L7-L32】【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/dao_governance.rs†L5-L37】. This timing model prevents stale decisions from re-entering deliberation and enforces responsive governance cycles suited to enterprise change-control standards.

## Security and Auditability
- **Audit Logging** – append‑only logs capture governance events for forensic review and compliance reporting【F:internal/governance/audit_log.go†L5-L28】.
- **Replay Protection** – a replay protector tracks previously processed identifiers, blocking duplicate or malicious transactions from re‑entering the system【F:internal/governance/replay_protection.go†L5-L24】.
- **Test Coverage** – unit tests validate that log entries persist and that replay identifiers cannot be reused, reinforcing operational reliability【F:internal/governance/audit_log_test.go†L5-L10】【F:internal/governance/replay_protection_test.go†L5-L12】.

These modules ensure governance actions remain traceable and resistant to tampering across distributed environments.

## Full Blockchain Governance
Governance spans the entire Synnergy stack. Authority nodes gatekeep policy changes, token-ledger balances and staking totals define voting weight, and smart-contract deadlines codify timeliness. CLI utilities and integration scripts wire these layers together so proposals flow from submission to audit logging without manual intervention, allowing Blackridge Group Ltd. to present a cohesive, end-to-end governance experience for regulators, enterprises and community stakeholders alike.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network governance framework couples programmable on‑chain logic with disciplined oversight. Through modular tokens, auditable services and secure tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a governance model that balances community participation with institutional accountability, positioning the platform for sustainable, transparent evolution.
