# Governance

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs Synnergy Network governance as a layered system that blends on‑chain transparency with off‑chain accountability. Authority nodes, token holders and automated services cooperate through audited smart‑contract logic to steer protocol evolution while preserving security and regulatory compliance.

## Governance Architecture
- **Authority Nodes** – regulated entities that validate proposals and execute approved changes. They operate dedicated tooling and are subject to continuous monitoring. An in‑memory index tracks each node’s address, role and recorded votes for rapid lookup and lifecycle management【F:internal/nodes/authority_nodes/index.go†L5-L55】.
- **Token‑Weighted Voting** – community participants wield governance tokens to propose upgrades, delegate voting power and ratify decisions.
- **Modular Services** – audit logging, replay protection and weight registries are implemented as isolated modules that can be composed into higher‑level governance applications.

## Governance Tokens
### SYN300 – Proposal and Voting Engine
The SYN300 governance token exposes delegation, proposal management and quorum‑based execution. Holders may delegate or revoke voting rights, query effective voting power, register proposals and cast approvals or rejections. Proposals can be inspected or listed for external review, and finalisation is gated behind explicit quorum checks that aggregate delegated balances, ensuring accountable decision making【F:internal/tokens/syn300_token.go†L43-L176】.

### SYN3600 – Weight Ledger
SYN3600 maintains a lightweight ledger of voting weights. Administrators assign and query address weights, enabling bespoke governance models such as council memberships or tiered franchises and providing a primitive for off‑chain registries to synchronise with on‑chain voting weight【F:internal/tokens/syn3600.go†L5-L27】.

## Authority Node Registry
Authority nodes are catalogued in a registry that supports add, remove, get and list operations. Each record stores the node’s address, assigned role and a map of votes cast by participants, allowing regulators to audit decision provenance and rotate participants with minimal overhead【F:internal/nodes/authority_nodes/index.go†L5-L56】.

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Delegation** – token holders optionally delegate voting power to trusted representatives.
2. **Submission** – a proposer registers a new governance proposal with descriptive metadata.
3. **Voting** – participants cast approvals or rejections; delegated balances are automatically counted.
4. **Execution** – when the approval voting power exceeds the configured quorum, proposals are finalised and enacted.

CLI tooling streamlines these steps. `governance_setup.sh` invokes the network binary with a proposal title and body file, while a lightweight wrapper `governance_propose.sh` offers quick submissions from development environments【F:scripts/governance_setup.sh†L1-L12】【F:cmd/scripts/governance_propose.sh†L1-L5】.

## Security and Auditability
- **Audit Logging** – append‑only logs capture governance events for forensic review and compliance reporting【F:internal/governance/audit_log.go†L5-L28】.
- **Replay Protection** – a replay protector tracks previously processed identifiers, blocking duplicate or malicious transactions from re‑entering the system【F:internal/governance/replay_protection.go†L5-L24】.
- **Test Coverage** – unit tests validate that log entries persist and that replay identifiers cannot be reused, reinforcing operational reliability【F:internal/governance/audit_log_test.go†L5-L10】【F:internal/governance/replay_protection_test.go†L5-L12】.

These modules ensure governance actions remain traceable and resistant to tampering across distributed environments.

## Integration and Enterprise Tooling
Governance primitives interface with consensus, token registries and node infrastructure. Delegated voting and weight assignments inform validator selection, proposal outcomes influence operational parameters, and audit logs provide regulators with verifiable histories. Through clean APIs and scripted tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. enables wallets, explorers and enterprise dashboards to embed governance workflows directly into user experiences and to automate compliance reporting.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network governance framework couples programmable on‑chain logic with disciplined oversight. Through modular tokens, auditable services and secure tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a governance model that balances community participation with institutional accountability, positioning the platform for sustainable, transparent evolution.
