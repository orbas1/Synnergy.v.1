# Nodes

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered by **Neto Solaris**, is built upon a
versatile node ecosystem. Nodes are distributed software agents that validate
transactions, maintain ledger state, enforce compliance, and surface network
intelligence. The architecture emphasizes modularity so that each node type can
be deployed independently or combined to serve bespoke operational roles.

Stage 79 enhances node provisioning with an orchestrated bootstrap flow. Administrators can run `synnergy orchestrator bootstrap --node-id node79 --authority ops=governor --replicate` to invoke `core.EnterpriseOrchestrator.BootstrapNetwork`, which signs the bootstrap, registers authority roles, starts replication and surfaces diagnostics confirming VM status, consensus networks, authority counts and replication activity prior to deploying additional node types.【F:cli/orchestrator.go†L58-L117】【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator.go†L71-L209】 Startup synchronises Stage 79 gas metadata and the control panel exposes the same workflow, aligning CLI automation, dashboards and GUI operators on cost visibility and readiness signals.【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L63-L106】【F:web/pages/index.js†L1-L214】【F:web/pages/api/bootstrap.js†L1-L45】 Bootstrap tests cover unit, situational, stress, functional and real-world cases, ensuring new node deployments maintain strong encryption, privacy and regulatory compliance even under heavy throughput.【F:core/enterprise_orchestrator_test.go†L73-L178】

## Core Node Architecture
Every node instance embeds several core subsystems:

- **Ledger Interface** – provides account balance and state management.
- **Synnergy Consensus** – selects validators and validates sub‑blocks before
  they are committed to the blockchain.
- **SNVM Virtual Machine** – executes smart‑contract opcodes in a sandboxed
  environment.
- **Mempool and Blockchain Stores** – track pending transactions and confirmed
  blocks.
- **Stake and Slashing Registry** – records validator stakes and enforces
  penalties for double‑signing or downtime.

These components allow a node to accept transactions, validate them against the
ledger, bundle them into sub‑blocks, and mine canonical blocks when consensus is
achieved.

## Node Classifications
Synnergy supports a broad spectrum of specialized nodes. The following
subsections summarize the primary classes available in the reference
implementation.

### Validator Nodes
Validator nodes extend the base node with validator management and quorum
tracking. They enforce minimum stake requirements, track validator membership,
and determine whether a quorum has been reached before new blocks are accepted.

### Mining Nodes
Mining nodes simulate proof‑of‑work behavior. They iterate at a configured hash
rate, generate candidate block hashes, and submit mined blocks back to the
network. A variant designed for battery‑powered devices, the **Mobile Mining
Node**, halts hashing automatically when battery levels fall below a
configurable threshold.

### Staking Nodes
Staking nodes maintain token stakes for multiple participants. They expose
interfaces to stake, unstake, and query balances, enabling lightweight staking
experiments without a full ledger implementation.

### Indexing Nodes
Indexing nodes build in‑memory key/value indices over ledger data to enable
rapid queries. They offer CRUD‑like semantics so that other services can query
state snapshots efficiently.

### Content Network Nodes
Content nodes register the availability of content items and expose metadata so
peers can discover hosted assets. They underpin distributed content delivery and
replication strategies across the network.

### Regulatory Nodes
Regulatory nodes integrate with `RegulatoryManager` services to evaluate
transactions against jurisdictional rules. When violations are detected, the
node records flags against offending addresses, supporting audit trails and
real‑time enforcement.

### Watchtower Nodes
Watchtower nodes monitor the network for forks and health anomalies. They
include a firewall, system health logger, and pluggable metrics exporter. These
nodes periodically collect telemetry and can report fork events for downstream
mitigation.

### Energy‑Efficient Nodes
Energy‑efficient nodes track transaction throughput relative to power
consumption and maintain sustainability certificates. They also allow operators
to assign carbon offset credits and determine when throttling is required to
meet efficiency targets.

### Environmental Monitoring Nodes
Environmental monitoring nodes ingest sensor data and evaluate it against
registered conditions. They can trigger automated actions—such as pausing
operations—when thresholds are exceeded.

### Geospatial Nodes
Geospatial nodes record latitude and longitude data for tracked subjects and
provide historical lookups. They enable use cases that rely on location
awareness and provenance tracking.

### Biometric Security Nodes
Biometric security nodes pair node identities with biometric authentication.
Privileged operations are gated behind biometric verification, delivering an
additional security layer for high‑risk workflows.

### Warfare Nodes
Warfare nodes extend the base node for military logistics. They securely record
logistics entries, process privileged commands after validation, and provide
hooks for sharing tactical information across secure channels.

### Forensic Nodes
Forensic nodes capture minimal `TransactionLite` records and granular network
traces so operators can reconstruct events during incident response and satisfy
evidentiary requirements. Buffers are capped and prune oldest entries in FIFO
order to prevent memory exhaustion from malicious peers.

### Historical Nodes
Historical nodes archive concise `BlockSummary` metadata and offer lookup
interfaces by height or hash, serving long‑term chain explorers and reducing the
load on production ledgers.

### Holographic Nodes
Holographic nodes distribute redundant `HolographicFrame` data across peers,
allowing critical state to be reconstituted even if portions of the network are
lost.

### Optimization Nodes
Optimization nodes analyse runtime metrics and emit scaling suggestions so that
orchestration layers can proactively right‑size compute and storage resources.

## Advanced Runtime Services
Beyond the role‑specific functionality, Synnergy nodes embed a collection of
enterprise‑grade services that harden runtime behavior and streamline
operations:

- **Firewall and Access Control** – concurrency‑safe block lists prevent
  interaction with sanctioned wallet addresses, token identifiers, or peer IPs,
  minimizing attack surface.
- **System Health Logging** – background routines collect CPU usage, memory
  allocation, peer counts, and last‑block height so operators can surface
  telemetry in dashboards or trigger alerts.
- **Zero‑Trust Data Channels** – encrypted, signature‑verified channels allow
  nodes to exchange sensitive payloads without assuming network trust,
  supporting verifiable off‑chain messaging and custody workflows.
- **Sandboxed Contract Execution** – a sandbox manager instantiates isolated
  virtual machines with gas and memory limits, enabling deterministic contract
  execution and rapid environment resets.
- **Dynamic Consensus Hopping** – nodes can evaluate throughput, latency, and
  validator counts to switch between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake, or
  proof‑of‑history consensus modes in real time.
- **Anomaly Detection** – streaming statistical models highlight deviations in
  runtime metrics, providing an early warning system for denial‑of‑service or
  misconfiguration events.
- **Identity Verification** – a ledger‑integrated `IdentityService` stores
  address metadata and verification logs to satisfy KYC and AML mandates.
- **Cross‑Chain Bridge Management** – a `CrossChainManager` registers bridge
  configurations and whitelists authorized relayers for controlled asset
  transfers.
- **Forensic and Historical Logging** – optional subsystems capture
  `TransactionLite` entries and block summaries to maintain audit‑ready evidence
  trails.
- **Resource Optimization Hooks** – optimization modules evaluate CPU, memory,
  latency, and throughput to produce autoscaling recommendations.

## Enterprise Deployment and Operations
Neto Solaris curates a full operations toolchain so organizations can
run nodes at scale:

- **High Availability** – nodes are shipped as container images with
  Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible manifests that support rolling upgrades and
  multi‑region failover.
- **Observability** – watchtower and system‑health components export metrics
  compatible with common monitoring stacks, while audit logs from regulatory
  and security modules integrate with SIEM platforms.
- **Governance and Compliance** – integration hooks allow nodes to enforce
  jurisdiction‑specific regulations, attach biometric requirements to privileged
  operations, and maintain carbon‑offset certificates for sustainability
  reporting.
- **Cross‑Chain and Private Connectivity** – nodes can bridge assets and data to
  external networks or leverage zero‑trust channels for private off‑chain
  coordination without compromising ledger integrity.
- **Resource Optimization** – optimization nodes feed utilization metrics into
  autoscaling policies so clusters adjust capacity before performance degrades.

## Node Lifecycle and Optimization
Nodes expose start and stop hooks for controlled rollouts, while the sandbox
manager enables deterministic resets of contract environments. System health
metrics gathered from runtime logging can be fed into optimization modules,
which analyse resource usage and recommend scaling actions to meet service‑level
objectives.

## Interconnectivity and Communication
All nodes use authenticated channels and can be fronted by a built‑in firewall
component. Zero‑trust data channels overlay existing RPC to protect sensitive
payloads. Indexing and content nodes may expose additional APIs for external
clients, while watchtower and regulatory nodes feed analytics and compliance
systems. Cross‑chain adapters enable selected nodes to interact with external
blockchains when required.

## Security and Compliance
Security is multi‑layered: biometric authentication prevents unauthorized
access, watchtower nodes surface anomalies, and regulatory nodes enforce
jurisdictional policy. The slashing registry protects consensus integrity by
penalizing malicious validators, while firewalls filter unwanted network
traffic. Identity services track verified addresses, cross‑chain bridges rely on
whitelisted relayers, and forensic and historical subsystems provide tamper‑
evident audit trails.

## Deployment and Maintenance
Neto Solaris provides container images and infrastructure‑as‑code
artifacts for orchestrating nodes across on‑premises or cloud environments.
Operators should monitor system health metrics, schedule regular certificate
renewal for energy‑efficient nodes, rotate keys used in biometric and regulatory
subsystems, and prune forensic or archival logs in accordance with retention
policies.

## Economic Incentives
Validator and mining nodes earn rewards through block production and fee
distribution. Staking nodes support delegators with transparent balance queries,
while energy‑efficient nodes can monetize sustainability certificates within
green‑energy marketplaces.

## Stage 79 Enhancements
- **Coordinated node bootstrap.** The Stage 79 runtime assembles ledger, VM, consensus and wallet services before CLI commands run, meaning every node class—authority, regulatory, custodial or watchtower—starts from a consistent, fault-tolerant baseline without bespoke wiring【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap.go†L17-L142】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L18-L55】.
- **Enterprise governance opcodes.** Newly catalogued primitives including `Node_Attest`, `Ledger_StreamReplication`, `Ledger_PrimaryElection`, `Ledger_PrivacyEnvelope` and `Loanpool_ComplianceDisburse` give operators verifiable workflows for attestation, failover, privacy-preserving exports and regulated payouts with documented gas ceilings for budgeting deployments【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L240-L404】【F:docs/reference/opcodes_list.md†L260-L700】【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L820-L839】.
- **Manifest-connected tooling.** A manifest-exporting CLI command now feeds the React control panel so operations teams can inspect node commands, required flags and dry-run behaviours in a browser, while regression tests keep the manifest contract stable across releases【F:cli/gui_manifest.go†L20-L118】【F:web/pages/api/commands.js†L1-L29】【F:web/pages/api/run.js†L1-L21】【F:web/pages/index.js†L87-L200】【F:cli/gui_cmd_test.go†L11-L82】.
- **Gas assurance for lifecycle actions.** Stage 79 tests verify that every required opcode is priced before nodes start, preventing migrations or recovery drills from running without the deterministic gas assumptions codified in the runtime【F:cmd/synnergy/bootstrap_test.go†L10-L41】【F:gas_table.go†L20-L167】.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy node framework empowers operators to tailor deployments to
specific roles—from lightweight indexing nodes to fully fledged validator or
regulatory instances. By combining modular subsystems with robust security and
compliance tooling, Neto Solaris delivers a flexible foundation for
next‑generation decentralized infrastructure.
