# Creditors

*Prepared for the Synnergy Network by **Neto Solaris***

## Overview
Creditor nodes are licensed financial entities that inject regulated liquidity into the Synnergy Network. Operating under the Neto Solaris governance model, they extend credit, originate debt instruments and steward on‑chain lending markets. Every creditor node maintains a verifiable identity, adheres to jurisdictional requirements and interfaces directly with the network's smart‑contract infrastructure. Enterprise‑grade controls govern onboarding, asset issuance, risk monitoring and operational resilience to ensure trust within global financial jurisdictions.

## Onboarding, Identity and Access Control
Before receiving lender privileges, each creditor establishes an auditable presence and is assigned protocol roles. The `IdentityService` records identity metadata and verification logs for network addresses, ensuring that only registered entities can operate【F:identity_verification.go†L22-L56】. Wallets are then registered through the `IDRegistry`, which binds addresses to descriptive metadata for traceability【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】. Role assignments are managed by the `AccessController`, which grants, revokes and checks permissions against a central registry【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】. Together, these modules enforce stringent entry requirements and allow Neto Solaris to revoke rights if a creditor falls out of compliance.

## Credential Security and Data Channels
Enterprise creditors must protect operational keys and communications. The `BiometricsAuth` module enables hashed biometric templates so nodes can require physical verification for sensitive actions【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】. For data in transit, the `ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted channels and signs every payload, ensuring that audit messages and loan instructions remain tamper‑evident across distributed infrastructure【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L67】.

## Asset Issuance and Tokenisation
Approved creditors may issue regulated instruments ranging from bonds to real‑estate tokens. Token contracts embed compliance rules; for example, `SYN223Token` enforces whitelist and blacklist controls so transfers only occur between authorised participants【F:core/syn223_token.go†L8-L31】【F:core/syn223_token.go†L61-L76】. These safeguards ensure that assets minted on Synnergy remain traceable and fully compliant with jurisdictional mandates.

## Role in the Synnergy Network
- **Regulated instrument issuance** – Creditor nodes can mint instruments such as bonds, ETFs and real‑estate tokens. These capabilities are restricted to roles explicitly authorised in the protocol's role‑based access controls.
- **Liquidity provisioning** – Creditors supply capital to borrowers through smart contracts, ensuring transparent terms, automated enforcement and immutable audit trails.
- **Governance participation** – Creditors may vote on proposals affecting lending policy, treasury allocation and systemic risk parameters.

## Permissions and Responsibilities
Creditor privileges are tightly scoped to protect the ecosystem:

1. **Onboarding and verification** – Each creditor registers through dedicated wallets and passes identity validation before receiving the permissions required to operate.
2. **Token authority** – Only approved creditors may deploy bill tokens or participate in the issuance of SYN‑10/11/12 compliant assets.
3. **Treasury stewardship** – Creditors must manage funds responsibly and remain subject to community oversight, including potential revocation of rights for malpractice.
4. **Regulatory alignment** – All activity must comply with local financial regulations, with AI‑assisted monitoring detecting anomalies and flagging suspicious behaviour.

## LoanPool and Credit Workflows
The LoanPool module is the primary interface for extending credit within the network. It maintains a treasury and tracks proposals from submission through disbursement. Core capabilities include:

- **SubmitProposal** – creditors create loan offers defining recipients, amounts and descriptive terms.
- **VoteProposal** – authorised stakeholders vote on each proposal.
- **Tick** – periodic evaluation of proposals promotes those with sufficient votes.
- **Disburse** – upon approval and treasury availability, funds are released to borrowers.

A reference implementation of these functions resides in `core/loanpool.go` and exposes the workflow that creditor nodes follow when underwriting loans【F:core/loanpool.go†L26-L75】. Supporting modules refine this process:

- `LoanProposal` structures the request and voting state【F:core/loanpool_proposal.go†L5-L46】.
- `LoanPoolApply` manages simplified applications for retail borrowers, performing submission, voting, processing and disbursement against the same treasury【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L5-L82】.
- `LoanPoolManager` enables administrators to pause operations and retrieve aggregate statistics such as approved and disbursed counts【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L3-L44】.
- `LoanPoolViews` exposes serialisable JSON records for proposals and applications, simplifying dashboard integration and audit trails【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L52】【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L54-L96】.
- Command‑line tooling mirrors these workflows. The `loanpool` CLI submits, votes, disburses and amends proposals while the companion `loanpool_apply` CLI streamlines applications for mass onboarding【F:cli/loanpool.go†L15-L122】【F:cli/loanpool_apply.go†L15-L90】.

## Regulatory and Compliance Framework
Neto Solaris enforces policy across the credit stack. The `RegulatoryManager` stores jurisdiction‑specific rules and evaluates transactions for violations【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L74】. `RegulatoryNode` instances consult these rules and flag non‑conforming entities before approving transfers【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】. At the operational level, the `ComplianceService` validates KYC commitments, records fraud signals and monitors transactions for anomalies, producing audit trails and risk scores for each address【F:compliance.go†L61-L124】. These records feed the persistent `AuditManager`, which logs events per address for later inspection, while scheduled reviews can be orchestrated through standardised scripts like `compliance_audit.sh`【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】【F:scripts/compliance_audit.sh†L1-L16】.

## AI‑Driven Risk Intelligence and Model Governance
Machine‑learning components augment human oversight. The `InferenceEngine` loads and executes deterministic models to score transactions for fraud risk【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L15-L46】, while the streaming `AnomalyDetector` computes z‑scores to surface atypical behaviour in real time【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. A `DriftMonitor` tracks model accuracy over time and flags performance degradation beyond configurable thresholds, enabling administrators to retrain or replace models【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L34】. Updated models are distributed through the on‑chain `ModelMarketplace`, which lists model hashes, CIDs and pricing for controlled deployment across creditor nodes【F:ai_model_management.go†L9-L46】. Together these modules supply continuous feedback into compliance systems and maintain model integrity throughout the network lifecycle.

## Operational Resilience
Enterprise creditors must maintain service even during outages. The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes backup nodes when the primary becomes unresponsive, providing high‑availability lending infrastructure【F:high_availability.go†L8-L70】.

## Security Monitoring and Audit Observability
A layered monitoring stack safeguards creditor operations. The `AuditManager` persists immutable event records, and the `AuditNode` exposes these logs to the network for tamper‑evident oversight【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】【F:core/audit_node.go†L12-L44】. Command‑line interfaces extend this functionality—`audit` records or lists events, while `audit_node` starts bootstrap services and streams logs for compliance teams【F:cli/audit.go†L15-L64】【F:cli/audit_node.go†L22-L79】. Runtime metrics and firewall rules further protect nodes: `SystemHealthLogger` captures CPU, memory and peer statistics for dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L40】, and `WatchtowerNode` combines these metrics with an embedded `Firewall` to block malicious addresses, tokens or IPs and report detected forks【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】【F:firewall.go†L5-L22】.

## Interoperability and Automation
Creditor services integrate with Synnergy’s cross‑chain layer so assets and repayments can traverse multiple networks. The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges, authorises relayers and tracks active links between chains【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L90】. Above this, the `TransactionManager` records lock‑mint and burn‑release transfers, creating immutable proofs that can be audited across participating chains【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】. Supporting components such as the `BridgeTransferManager` lock assets and release them upon proof submission, while the `ConnectionManager` opens and closes links between remote networks for fully auditable interoperability【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L66】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L58】. Combined with the CLI interfaces above, these capabilities enable automated portfolios, scheduled disbursements and seamless inter‑network settlement.

## Transaction Control and Receipts
Creditor nodes manage high‑value transfers with deterministic tooling. Transactions can be scheduled for future execution, reversed through authority‑mediated votes within defined windows and even converted to private AES‑GCM payloads for confidential disbursement【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L136】. Every operation emits a `Receipt` that is stored and searchable, providing auditable trails for regulators and accounting teams【F:core/transaction_control.go†L160-L210】.

## Interaction with Other Nodes
Creditor nodes collaborate with authority, government and central bank nodes. Many decisions—especially those involving public funds from the LoanPool—require multi‑party approval. This layered consensus ensures that no single creditor can unilaterally manipulate liquidity or violate governance mandates.

## Contribution to the Ecosystem
By extending capital to individuals, businesses and public initiatives, creditors stimulate growth and enable broader adoption of the Synnergy Network. Their activities support grant programs, secured and unsecured lending, and ecosystem innovation funds, aligning financial incentives with community development.

## Summary
Creditors serve as the network's financial backbone, delivering regulated credit services through verifiable smart contracts and cooperative governance. Neto Solaris recognises their role as essential to a resilient, transparent and inclusive digital economy.
