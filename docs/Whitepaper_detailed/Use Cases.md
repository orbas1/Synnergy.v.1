# Use Cases

## Regulated Finance
- **Instant Settlement** – banks integrate with the CLI and gas subscriptions to offer deterministic settlement fees for cross-border payments.
- **Loan Servicing** – authority nodes leverage the VM sandbox to execute loan adjustments and reversals with full audit trails and signed approvals.【F:virtual_machine.go†L1-L186】
- **Service Entitlements** – managed service providers meter premium API usage with the SYN500 token, combining wallet-authenticated grants, windowed consumption, and telemetry exports for billing and compliance.【F:core/syn500.go†L1-L150】【F:cli/syn500.go†L1-L172】

## Supply Chain
- **Asset Provenance** – manufacturers encode provenance data as content node records; gas telemetry ensures predictable costs for digital twin updates.【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L75-L109】
- **Dispute Resolution** – reversal workflows allow authorised parties to resolve disputes while preserving immutable audit trails.【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Reversing and cancelling transactions.md†L1-L19】

## Digital Identity
- **Verified Credentials** – Synthron Coin ledger entries link identity attestations with immutable payment history, helping enterprises satisfy KYC/AML audits.【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Synthron Coin.go†L1-L167】
- **Compliance Reporting** – regulatory nodes export signed gas snapshots and ledger digests to supervisory authorities without manual intervention.【F:gas_table.go†L20-L152】

## Developer Ecosystem
- **Smart Contract Marketplaces** – developers deploy pre-approved templates with predictable gas costs and hot-reloadable handlers.
- **Testing Sandboxes** – integration partners run dedicated VM instances, consume live gas feeds, and verify behaviour against the open-source test suites before promoting to production.【F:virtual_machine_test.go†L1-L96】【F:core/virtual_machine_test.go†L1-L108】
