# Ledger

## Introduction
Within the Synnergy network engineered by **Neto Solaris**, the ledger is the canonical record of all value exchange and state transitions. It fuses block history, account balances, and unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) into a cohesive state machine that every service in the ecosystem relies upon.

## Architectural Overview
### Data Model
The ledger exposes a write‑ahead log (WAL) backed structure that persists blocks while tracking balances, UTXO sets, a mempool, and frozen accounts【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L33】. Each state mutation is gated by mutexes to guarantee thread‑safety across concurrent operations【F:core/ledger.go†L24-L33】.

### Block and Sub‑Block Flow
Transactions are first ordered into validator‑signed sub‑blocks before being aggregated into proof‑of‑work blocks, each linking to the previous hash to extend the chain【F:core/block.go†L10-L56】. Nodes mine these blocks and append them to their local ledger while distributing rewards and fees【F:core/node.go†L58-L93】.

### Transaction Schema and Validation
Transactions encapsulate sender and recipient addresses, value, fees, nonces, timestamps, optional biometric hashes, and executable programs for the Synnergy Virtual Machine【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L36】. Deterministic hashing and signature verification ensure integrity, while biometric attachments bind transactions to verified identities【F:core/transaction.go†L38-L95】.

## State Management
### Accounts, UTXOs, and Mempool
Balances and UTXO sets are updated atomically whenever credits, mints, transfers, or arbitrary transactions are applied. A dedicated mempool queues pending transactions for inclusion in subsequent blocks【F:core/ledger.go†L115-L186】.

### WAL, Snapshots, and Recovery
Blocks are appended to the chain and optionally written to a WAL. On restart the ledger replays the log to restore state, allowing nodes to recover without network assistance【F:core/ledger.go†L35-L84】.

### Snapshot Compression and Backup
Operators can checkpoint state by writing compressed snapshots and later restoring them. Built‑in helpers compress the ledger to a gzipped JSON representation and reload it on demand【F:core/blockchain_compression.go†L20-L83】. CLI subcommands allow saving and loading these snapshots for migration or audits【F:cli/compression.go†L23-L57】. For long‑term retention, a utility script packages the ledger directory into timestamped archives for off‑site backup【F:scripts/backup_ledger.sh†L1-L40】.

## Block Lifecycle and Consensus
Nodes package mempool contents into sub‑blocks, mine blocks, apply transactions to the ledger, and distribute fees proportionally to validators and miners. Stake is adjusted based on validator performance, enabling dynamic consensus weightings【F:core/node.go†L58-L93】.

## Replication and Synchronisation
A Replicator propagates newly mined blocks or snapshots to peers, while the Sync Manager coordinates download and verification to keep nodes aligned with the network head【F:core/replication.go†L5-L49】【F:core/blockchain_synchronization.go†L8-L53】.

## Indexing and Query Layer
For low‑latency access, an Indexing Node materialises ledger data into an in‑memory key/value store, supporting rapid queries and key enumeration for analytic services【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L61】.

## Sharding and Horizontal Scaling
A Shard Manager assigns leaders to shards, tracks cross‑shard receipts, and rebalances workloads when hot spots emerge, enabling horizontal growth of ledger capacity【F:core/sharding.go†L7-L95】. The CLI exposes subcommands for inspecting shard maps, submitting cross‑shard transaction headers, and increasing shard counts on demand【F:cli/sharding.go†L12-L113】.

## Cross‑Chain Interoperability
The bridge manager locks assets on the source chain and records transfer claims, using the ledger to debit senders and credit recipients once proofs are provided【F:core/cross_chain_bridge.go†L9-L144】.

## Zero‑Trust Channels and Escrow
Privacy‑sensitive workflows leverage a Zero Trust Engine that manages encrypted channels backed by ledger escrows. Messages are encrypted, signed, and verified to ensure confidentiality and authenticity, while participant governance, retention policies and event feeds provide operational oversight for regulated deployments【F:core/zero_trust_data_channels.go†L1-L279】.

## Regulatory Oversight
A regulatory manager evaluates transactions against jurisdictional rules and flags violations, enabling regulator‑operated nodes to log and escalate suspicious activity【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L50】.

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery
Failover tooling monitors node heartbeats and promotes the most recent backup if a primary becomes unresponsive, keeping the ledger reachable through outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】. Combined with replication and snapshot backups, this provides enterprise‑grade resilience.

## Node Integration and CLI Tooling
Every network node embeds a ledger instance for transaction validation, stake accounting, and block creation【F:core/node.go†L8-L44】. Operators can inspect or manipulate state through a rich CLI, exposing commands for querying heads, blocks, balances, UTXO sets, the mempool, and for minting or transferring tokens【F:cli/ledger.go†L12-L113】.

## Security and Auditability
The genesis block is created during initialisation and safeguarded by an Immutability Enforcer that verifies its hash, preventing alteration of the chain’s origin【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L41】【F:core/immutability_enforcement.go†L5-L31】. Combined with deterministic hashing, signature checks, and mutex‑serialised mutations, the ledger offers a tamper‑evident foundation suitable for regulatory compliance and auditing.

## Future Enhancements
Planned research areas include adaptive sharding heuristics driven by real‑time telemetry, incremental snapshot pruning to reclaim disk space without downtime, and erasure‑coded replication streams to minimize bandwidth while preserving durability.

## Conclusion
The ledger is the heartbeat of the Synnergy network. By integrating persistent storage, rich transaction semantics, replication, cross‑chain hooks, and zero‑trust security controls, it enables **Neto Solaris** to deliver a resilient and interoperable financial infrastructure for decentralised applications.
