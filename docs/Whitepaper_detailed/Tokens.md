# Tokens

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network token framework to support a diverse ecosystem of digital assets. Each token type encapsulates specific business logic, enabling regulated financial operations, real‑world asset representation and community governance. The architecture combines secure ledgers, structured registries and extensible smart‑contract interfaces to allow token classes to operate independently while remaining interoperable across the network.

## Token Framework Overview
Tokens on Synnergy Network are implemented as Go modules that maintain their own state and persistence model. Ledgers and registries are used to manage balances, metadata and transactional history. This modular approach allows Blackridge Group Ltd. to:

- Tailor functionality to the asset class or utility.
- Enforce compliance through whitelists, blacklists and certification metadata.
- Provide deterministic APIs for minting, transferring, burning and querying tokens.

## Monetary and Financial Instruments
### SYN10 – Central Bank Digital Currency
`syn10.go` embeds a base ledger and protects issuer metadata and exchange
rates with a dedicated mutex. The `SetExchangeRate` function atomically
updates the fiat peg while `Info` exposes the current issuer details and
total supply for audit trails.

### SYN11 – Central Bank Digital Gilts
`syn11_token.go` models government bond instruments issued by central banks.
Fixed‑rate metadata tracks coupon schedules and redemption amounts, letting
treasuries settle gilt obligations on chain.

### SYN12 – Tokenised Treasury Bill
`syn12.go` structures a treasury bill with issue and maturity dates,
discount and face value. Instances are created via `NewSYN12Token`, which
captures the immutable `SYN12Metadata` used for settlement calculations.

### SYN20 – Pausable and Freezable Ledger
`syn20.go` extends the base token with emergency controls. Mutex‑guarded
flags allow administrators to pause all transfers or freeze specific
addresses, and overrides ensure `Transfer`, `Mint` and `Burn` respect these
restrictions.

### SYN1000 – Reserve‑Backed Stablecoin
`syn1000.go` tracks backing assets as high‑precision rational numbers and
guards the reserve map with a read/write mutex. Functions such as
`AddReserve`, `SetReservePrice` and `TotalReserveValue` let operators manage
collateral transparently.

### SYN1000 Index – Stablecoin Manager
`syn1000_index.go` orchestrates multiple stablecoin instances. A central
registry creates tokens, retrieves them by `TokenID` and proxies reserve
updates so enterprises can administer distinct fiat pegs under one service.

### SYN2100 – Trade Finance Ledger
`syn2100.go` maintains structured invoices and liquidity pools for trade
finance. Registries register documents, mark financing status and track pool
contributions, enabling on‑chain factoring and invoice discounting.

## Governance and Membership Tokens
### DAO Membership Ledger
`dao_token.go` implements a simple ledger that mints, transfers and burns tokens representing voting rights within a decentralised autonomous organisation. The ledger locks access with a `sync.RWMutex` to prevent race conditions and exposes `Mint`, `Transfer`, `Balance` and `Burn` methods for membership management.

### SYN300 – Governance Token
`syn300_token.go` provides advanced on‑chain governance. Holders may delegate voting power, propose network changes and vote on proposals. Quorum checks ensure proposals only execute when approval power meets predefined thresholds. Proposal and vote data are timestamped for auditability.

### SYN1500 – Reputation Token
`syn1500.go` tracks reputation adjustments through `ReputationEvent` entries, allowing communities to weight governance influence or service access based on historical behaviour.

### SYN2500 – DAO Registry
`syn2500_token.go` maintains structured membership records including join time, voting power and arbitrary metadata. The registry enables Blackridge Group Ltd. to build rich DAO applications that track member evolution without affecting underlying token balances.

## Asset‑Backed Tokens
### SYN130 – Tangible Assets
`token_syn130.go` models real‑world assets with valuation, ownership and lease tracking. Sale history and lease agreements are recorded to support secondary markets or rental models.

### SYN131 – Intangible Assets
`syn131_token.go` represents non‑physical assets such as patents or trademarks. Tokens carry a valuation field and can be updated through controlled registries.

### SYN800 – Certified Asset Registry
`syn800_token.go` stores metadata for physical items, including location, asset type and certification identifiers. Valuation updates are timestamped to maintain an immutable audit trail.

### SYN4900 – Agricultural Commodities
`token_syn4900.go` tokenises agricultural goods with origin, quantity, harvest/expiry dates and a chronological event history. Ownership transfers append events, ensuring full provenance for supply‑chain compliance.

### SYN1300 – Supply Chain Tracking
`syn1300.go` captures status changes for assets as they move through logistics networks. Events such as location updates or condition reports are appended to asset history for comprehensive traceability.

### SYN3000 – Rental Tokens
`SYN3000.go` records rental agreements with metadata for lease terms,
payments and return conditions, enabling on‑chain management of equipment
or property rentals.

## Investment and Market Tokens
### SYN1401 – Investment Records
`syn1401.go` issues time‑bound investments with principal, rate and maturity data. `Accrue` compounds interest since the last check, while `Redeem` validates ownership and maturity before returning principal plus earnings.

### SYN2600 – Investor Tokens
`syn2600.go` registers share allocations for funded projects. The `Issue` constructor validates expiry dates, `Transfer` reassigns ownership and `RecordReturn` appends distribution events so investors can audit payouts.

### SYN2700 – Dividend Distributor
`syn2700.go` maintains holder balances and computes proportional payouts. `AddHolder` updates the supply and `Distribute` returns a map of address‑to‑dividend amounts without mutating internal state.

### SYN3100 – Employment Contracts
`syn3100.go` stores employment terms, compensation and tenure data,
providing a verifiable record of labour agreements across enterprises.

### SYN3200 – Conversion Token
`syn3200.go` applies a configurable ratio to model wrapped or convertible assets. `Convert` multiplies an amount by the current ratio and `SetRatio` safely updates the conversion factor at runtime.

### SYN3400 – Forex Pair Registry
`syn3400.go` tracks currency pairs with update timestamps. `Register` assigns a pair ID, `UpdateRate` revises the exchange rate and `List` exposes all pairs for market dashboards.

### SYN3800 – Capped Supply Token
`syn3800.go` enforces a hard supply limit. `Mint` and `Burn` guard against cap violations, and `Supply` reports current circulation for audit trails.

### SYN3900 – Vesting Registry
`syn3900.go` locks grants until a release time. `Grant` schedules an amount for an address and `Release` returns funds once the timestamp elapses, preventing double spends.

## Utility and Functional Tokens

### SYN3500 – Stable Currency
`syn3500_token.go` models a centrally issued currency or stablecoin. Balances are maintained per address, while the issuer can update the exchange rate to track fiat value. Minting and redemption functions support monetary policy control.

### SYN3700 – Index Token
`syn3700_token.go` aggregates multiple asset tokens into a weighted index. Components can be added or removed, and index value is calculated from external price feeds.

### SYN4200 – Charity Token
`syn4200_token.go` facilitates charitable campaigns. Donations accumulate per symbol, and campaign snapshots expose progress and donor contributions, enabling transparent fundraising.

## Gaming and Loyalty Tokens
### SYN70 – In‑Game Assets
`syn70.go` registers game items with owners, titles and achievements. `TransferAsset` moves ownership, while `SetAttribute` and `AddAchievement` enrich metadata for player progression.

### SYN2369 – Virtual World Items
`syn2369.go` manages metaverse objects through an `ItemRegistry`. `CreateItem` assigns IDs and timestamps, `TransferItem` updates custodians and `UpdateAttributes` modifies trait maps for evolving assets.

### SYN500 – Loyalty Points
`syn500.go` grants promotional balances with explicit expiries. `Mint` seeds an account, and `Redeem` returns points only if they remain valid at redemption time.

## Insurance and Risk Management Tokens
### SYN845 – Debt Instruments

## Token Lifecycle
1. **Creation and Minting** – New tokens or assets are registered through constructors such as `NewTangibleAssetRegistry`, `NewSYN3500Token` or `NewAgriculturalRegistry`.
2. **Transfer and Ownership Management** – Ledgers expose safe `Transfer` functions that validate balances and authorisation. Asset tokens like SYN1700 or SYN130 update ownership directly within their registries.
3. **Burning and Redemption** – Tokens such as the DAO ledger and SYN3500 support deflationary operations through `Burn` or `Redeem` methods.
4. **Valuation and Status Updates** – Asset classes include methods like `UpdateValuation`, `UpdateStatus` or `SetRate` to reflect market or lifecycle changes.
5. **Audit and History** – Many token structures append events to historical arrays, creating immutable audit logs vital for regulatory review.
6. **Cross‑Chain Settlement** – Tokens such as SYN5000 surface hooks for bridge services so balances and bets can move between chains without breaking accounting.
7. **CLI and API Automation** – Each module ships with matching CLI commands under `cli/` enabling enterprises to script minting, transfers and registry queries.

## Security and Compliance
Blackridge Group Ltd. embeds security controls across token modules:

- **Whitelisting & Blacklisting** – SYN223 prevents illicit transfers by validating recipient addresses.
- **Certification Metadata** – SYN800 and SYN4900 tokens record certification details to meet industry standards.
- **Mutex‑Protected State** – Concurrency locks across ledgers and registries protect against race conditions during transactions.
- **Provenance Tracking** – Event histories in SYN1300, SYN4900 and lease/sale records in SYN130 provide full traceability for asset provenance.
- **Access‑Controlled Records** – SYN1100 gates healthcare data behind granular access lists to maintain patient confidentiality.
- **Dispute Logging** – SYN4700 records legal disputes and status transitions to support evidentiary workflows.

## Interoperability
Although each token manages its own state, consistent Go interfaces enable integration with other modules such as the virtual machine, cross‑chain bridge and governance services. Registries can be exposed via APIs or smart contracts, allowing tokens to participate in broader DeFi, supply‑chain or charity ecosystems managed by Blackridge Group Ltd.
