LoanPool Module
Overview
The LoanPool is a strategically managed pool of funds derived from a portion of transaction fees, designed to foster innovation and support critical areas such as healthcare, poverty alleviation, education, environmental sustainability, small business support, and ecosystem innovation within the ecosystem and beyond. The funds in the LoanPool are meticulously allocated into various categories to address diverse community needs, ensuring efficient and transparent usage in line with system governance and authorization protocols. Below are the detailed allocations and their specific purposes:

## Stage 82 Operational Guarantees

Stage 82 links the LoanPool to the enterprise bootstrap pipeline. When operators run
`synnergy orchestrator bootstrap`, the runtime verifies that the consensus mesh is
synchronised, the orchestrator wallet is sealed, ledger reads succeed and authority
roles are intact before any loan proposal is evaluated. The CLI and web dashboard
display the orchestrator's wallet seal status, consensus relayer count and authority
role distribution, enabling compliance teams to halt disbursements if governance
prerequisites are not met. Gas metadata for LoanPool governance and compliance
operations is registered during bootstrap so borrowers, regulators and auditors see
identical fee schedules across documentation, CLI output and the JavaScript control
panel.
