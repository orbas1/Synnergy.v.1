# Authority Nodes – Stage 77 Operational Blueprint

Authority nodes enforce governance, compliance and emergency controls across the
Synnergy Network. Stage 77 aligns authority node operations with the new runtime
integration, ensuring that CLI commands, consensus logic, wallet approvals and
the web dashboard orchestrate the same state.

## Governance and Access Control

- `GovernmentAuthorityNode` embeds the base authority node and prohibits
  monetary-policy mutations while providing departmental context for audit
  trails, matching the legal constraints imposed on public-sector validators【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L1-L35】.
- Authority staking, voting and proposal workflows are bootstrapped by the
  runtime integration which stakes the operator wallet and registers it with the
  regulatory node before any governance action executes, preventing unauthorised
  participation and maintaining deterministic quorum calculations【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L39-L126】.
- CLI subcommands expose proposal management, role updates and validator
  lifecycle controls so authority operators can manage governance artefacts with
  the same runtime used by Kubernetes and Terraform deployments【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L1-L160】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L38-L125】.

## Security, Privacy and Compliance

- Regulatory nodes validate every authority-signed transaction using stored
  public keys, ensuring signatures originate from approved wallets and that
  ledger entries satisfy jurisdictional rules before entering consensus【F:core/regulatory_node.go†L17-L70】.
- Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform manifests mount encrypted secrets, apply
  network policies and enforce non-root execution to protect authority node
  credentials across container, VM and bare metal environments【F:docker/Dockerfile†L1-L49】【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L231】.
- `EnsureGasCosts` and runtime integration tests verify that every authority
  operation—including role renewals, flagging and audit logging—carries the gas
  pricing documented in the reference guides, eliminating the risk of undocumented
  or mispriced authority actions【F:gas_table.go†L108-L126】【F:integration_test.go†L5-L66】.

## Fault Tolerance and Observability

- Authority nodes participate in the Stage 77 health loop, emitting ledger height
  and consensus status via the runtime integration channel so operators can
  monitor uptime through the CLI, Next.js dashboard or Kubernetes probes【F:internal/runtime/integration.go†L133-L192】【F:cmd/synnergy/main.go†L109-L125】.
- PodDisruptionBudgets and auto-scaling policies in the Kubernetes manifests
  guarantee authority representation during upgrades or failure scenarios while
  preserving consensus quorum requirements【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L143】.
- Terraform’s network load balancer and IAM instance profile distribute traffic
  across authority nodes and centralise access control, enabling controlled
  rotation of keys and infrastructure with audit-ready traceability【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L73-L189】.

## Interoperability and Web Integration

- The JavaScript function web consumes the same RPC endpoints exposed by the
  CLI, enabling authority dashboards for voting, compliance checks and gas
  budgeting without custom backends【F:docker/docker-compose.yml†L1-L64】.
- Cross-chain and consensus opcodes remain available to authority contracts,
  allowing on-chain governance decisions to react to external events or federate
  policy across partner blockchains in a deterministic, auditable manner【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L200-L320】.

Stage 77 delivers an authority node architecture that is secure, compliant and
resilient across CLI, automation and web channels, ensuring governance
operations scale with the enterprise demands of the Synnergy Network.
