# Authority Nodes

## Introduction
Authority nodes form the governance backbone of the Synnergy Network, providing policy enforcement, regulatory compliance, and rapid dispute resolution. Operated and maintained by **Neto Solaris**, the authority layer safeguards the network while upholding decentralisation principles. These nodes oversee sensitive operations, perform identity checks, and authorise exceptional actions such as transaction reversals.

## Architecture Overview
Enterprise deployments demand predictable behaviour and strict auditability. Synnergy therefore implements authority nodes as a layered service:

- **Thread-safe core** – Each registry operation is protected by read–write locks, ensuring concurrent registration and voting without race conditions【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L34-L129】.
- **Indexed lookups** – A dedicated `AuthorityNodeIndex` maps addresses to node records and exposes snapshot and JSON methods for deterministic state replication across clients【F:core/authority_node_index.go†L8-L67】.
- **Modular extensions** – Specialised structures such as elected and government nodes embed the base `AuthorityNode` type, allowing policy‑specific behaviour while reusing shared mechanics【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

## Governance Responsibilities
Authority nodes serve several critical governance functions:

- **Policy enforcement:** Nodes can freeze or reverse transactions during fraud investigations while maintaining auditable trails.
- **Identity verification:** Before sensitive actions are approved, authority nodes validate participants using multi-factor and biometric checks.
- **Network oversight:** They monitor banking nodes, compliance modules, and cross-chain bridges to ensure protocol adherence and regulatory alignment.
- **Dispute arbitration:** Nodes convene to adjudicate contested transactions and resource allocations, producing on-chain records of their decisions.

## Authority Node Registry
All authority nodes are tracked in a canonical registry that supports registration, voting, and information retrieval. The registry exposes methods to:

- **Register or deregister nodes** while preventing duplicates【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L45-L55】【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L124-L129】.
- **Cast and withdraw votes** through `Vote` and `RemoveVote`, maintaining a map of approving voters per candidate【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L57-L76】.
- **Query membership and metadata** via `IsAuthorityNode`, `Info`, and `List` for downstream services and audits【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L98-L122】.

The accompanying index provides constant‑time retrieval and safe snapshots for off‑chain analytics or checkpointing【F:core/authority_node_index.go†L8-L63】.

## Voting and Electorate Mechanics
Beyond simple vote tallying, the registry can derive a representative electorate. `Electorate` orders candidates by vote count, shuffles ties to avoid bias, and returns a deterministically sized slice for consensus operations【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L78-L95】. This mechanism enables quorum selection for tasks such as transaction reversals or policy ratification.

## Node Types
Synnergy distinguishes between multiple authority node categories to balance power and accountability. Categories include elected, government, central banking, banking, regulator, creditor, and military nodes:

### Elected Authority Nodes
Community-elected nodes hold privileges for a fixed term. The implementation records a term end timestamp and exposes an `IsActive` check to enforce expiration【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】.

### Government Authority Nodes
Government-operated nodes participate in compliance processes but intentionally lack capabilities to mint native tokens or adjust monetary policy, preserving separation of duties【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

### Central Banking Authority Nodes
Central banks operate dedicated nodes that manage CBDC issuance while safeguarding the fixed SYN supply. `CentralBankingNode` embeds monetary policy metadata and a SYN10 token interface, enabling policy updates and controlled token minting without altering native coin supply【F:core/central_banking_node.go†L9-L37】.

### Banking Authority Nodes
Institutional banking nodes coordinate registered financial entities. The `BankInstitutionalNode` maintains a thread-safe registry of participating institutions, allowing banks to join or withdraw and exposing snapshots for audits and compliance checks【F:core/bank_institutional_node.go†L8-L33】.

### Regulator Authority Nodes
Regulator nodes enforce jurisdictional rules by evaluating transactions and flagging violations. `RegulatoryNode` pairs with a `RegulatoryManager` to approve compliant transfers and record enforcement logs for each address【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】.

### Creditor Authority Nodes
Creditor nodes administer the network's lending facilities. They steward a shared `LoanPool` treasury that accepts proposals, tallies votes, and disburses approved funds to recipients【F:core/loanpool.go†L9-L74】. Retail requests flow through `LoanPoolApply`, which records applications, tracks votes, and processes approved loans against the same pool【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L17-L63】.

### Military Authority Nodes
Military-operated nodes extend the base node with secure command execution, signed operational envelopes and live telemetry for defence assets. `WarfareNode` now issues commander key pairs, enforces nonce-monotonic signatures, records logistics/tactical updates, and streams events for audit dashboards and automated response playbooks【F:core/warfare_node.go†L25-L357】.

## Application and Election Workflow
Prospective authority nodes submit on-chain applications detailing their role and description. The **AuthorityApplicationManager** assigns a sequential ID, tracks approvals and rejections, and finalises successful candidates into the registry【F:core/authority_apply.go†L11-L104】. Applications expire after a configurable TTL and are periodically purged by `Tick`, guaranteeing that stale requests do not linger【F:core/authority_apply.go†L106-L115】. Voting can be performed through CLI commands that register, vote, and list authority nodes, enabling transparent elections【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L20-L112】.

## Transaction Oversight
Authority nodes mediate transaction reversals via a structured process. `RequestReversal` freezes recipient funds, collects votes, and `FinalizeReversal` executes compensating transfers only if sufficient approvals are recorded within the 30‑day window【F:core/transaction_control.go†L52-L105】. Failed or expired requests automatically release frozen balances, ensuring fairness to all participants.

## Economic Incentives and Compliance
Authority nodes earn a predefined share of network fees. The distribution policy allocates five percent of every transaction fee to authority node operations, with the remainder routed to development, charity, validators, and other stakeholders【F:core/fees.go†L101-L128】. Rewards accrue in a dedicated genesis wallet, providing a transparent pool for compensation and infrastructure funding【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L41】. To maintain eligibility, nodes must uphold jurisdictional regulations, maintain audit logs, and demonstrate continuous uptime or risk deregistration.

## Interfaces and Tooling
Neto Solaris provides multiple interfaces for managing authority nodes:

- **CLI Suite:** Commands under `authority` and `authority_apply` allow registration, voting, application submission, and status queries, as documented in the core command overview【F:README.md†L126-L142】.
- **Authority Node Index GUI:** A TypeScript-based dashboard lists authority nodes and surfaces metadata for operators, delivering a consistent interface across environments.
- **Node Operations Dashboard:** REST endpoints exposed by authority nodes feed into system monitoring tools for real-time health and compliance metrics.

## Operational Resilience
Authority nodes leverage the network's failover framework to guarantee availability. The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and promotes the most recent backup if the primary becomes unresponsive, ensuring continuity during infrastructure outages or maintenance windows【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

## Security Considerations
To mitigate centralisation risks, authority nodes operate on hardened infrastructure with mandatory multi-factor authentication, encrypted communications, and regular key rotations. Deterministic JSON encoders across registries and applications provide tamper-evident logs for forensic review【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L22-L31】【F:core/authority_apply.go†L139-L151】. Critical actions require quorum-based approvals, and all authority operations are recorded on-chain for transparency and post‑event audits.

## Conclusion
Authority nodes, stewarded by **Neto Solaris**, balance decentralised participation with necessary oversight. Through rigorous application processes, specialised node types, and comprehensive tooling, the Synnergy Network achieves a resilient governance model capable of evolving with regulatory landscapes while protecting its users.
