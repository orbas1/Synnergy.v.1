# Security Audit Results

The following security tools were executed:

```bash
go vet ./...
gosec ./...
```

## go vet

`go vet` reported no issues.

## gosec findings

`gosec ./...` flagged 170 issues across the codebase. Key examples include:

- Integer overflow risk when converting lengths in the virtual machine (`virtual_machine.go:147`)
- Use of a non-cryptographic random generator in the mining node (`mining_node.go:110`)
- Multiple CLI commands with unhandled errors, such as `base_token.go` and `syn10.go`

These findings should be reviewed and addressed prior to release.

## Test summary

All unit tests pass:

```bash
go test ./...
```
