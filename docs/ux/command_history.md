# Stage 133: Command History and Favorites

Repeatedly typing the same commands slows operators down. A persistent history makes the panel feel more like a terminal while still offering guard rails.

## Storage Strategy
- Use browser `localStorage` or IndexedDB to record recent commands and timestamps.
- Allow users to mark entries as favorites so they remain pinned at the top.
- Provide an option to clear history for shared or public devices.

## Interface Ideas
- Drop‑down history beneath the command field with search and arrow‑key navigation.
- Quick‑launch buttons for favorites so common tasks are a single click away.
- Tooltip previews showing the full command before execution.

## Security Considerations
- Never store private keys or secrets; only persist command strings and metadata.
- Encrypt history when multi‑user authentication is introduced.
- Respect browser privacy modes by disabling history when storage is unavailable.

## Checklist
- [ ] Recent commands persist across page reloads.
- [ ] Users can remove individual entries or clear all history.
- [ ] Favorites are visually distinct and easily accessible.

A thoughtful history system turns the control panel into a powerful, personalized workspace.
