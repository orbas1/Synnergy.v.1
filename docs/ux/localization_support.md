# Stage 132: Localization and Internationalization

Supporting multiple languages broadens adoption and shows respect for regional norms. Localization should be planned early to avoid hard‑coded text and formatting issues.

## Strategy
- Externalize all user‑facing strings into translation files (e.g., JSON or YAML).
- Use a library such as i18next to handle pluralization and runtime language switching.
- Provide locale‑aware formatting for dates, times and numbers using the browser's Intl APIs.

## Workflow
1. Audit existing components and replace literal strings with translation keys.
2. Establish a translation pipeline and guidelines for contributors to submit new languages.
3. Detect the user's preferred locale on first load and allow manual overrides via a settings menu.

## Considerations
- Account for text expansion in layouts; translated strings may be longer.
- Support right‑to‑left languages by flipping layout direction when required.
- Ensure that translated documentation and error messages remain consistent with CLI terminology.

## Checklist
- [ ] All UI strings are stored outside the source code.
- [ ] Users can switch languages without reloading the page.
- [ ] Locale formatting matches regional expectations.

Internationalization turns the control panel into a global tool accessible to the entire community.
