# Stage 127: Accessibility Support

Ensuring that the control panel is usable by everyone requires attention to accessibility from the earliest design stages. Users may rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation or high‑contrast themes to operate the interface effectively.

## Best Practices
- **Semantic HTML** – Use proper heading levels, lists and buttons so assistive technologies can interpret the page structure.
- **ARIA attributes** – Provide `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` attributes on interactive elements and status messages.
- **Keyboard navigation** – Maintain a logical tab order and visible focus outlines to support users who cannot use a mouse.
- **Contrast and scaling** – Meet WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios and allow font sizes to scale without breaking the layout.

## Implementation Steps
1. Audit current templates with tools such as `axe-core` or Lighthouse.
2. Replace generic `<div>` containers with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>` and `<button>`.
3. Associate each form field with a `<label>` and ensure error messages are programmatically linked to their inputs.
4. Provide skip‑to‑content links and ensure modals trap focus until dismissed.

## Testing
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS) to verify that labels and status updates are read correctly.
- Confirm that all functionality is accessible via keyboard and that focus is never lost off‑screen.
- Include accessibility checks in the CI pipeline to prevent regressions.

## Checklist
- [ ] All interactive elements have descriptive labels.
- [ ] Pages pass automated audits with no critical errors.
- [ ] High‑contrast mode maintains readability and visual hierarchy.

Prioritizing accessibility not only expands the potential user base but also improves usability for everyone.
