# Stage 134: Authentication and Role-Based Access

Exposing powerful commands without authentication invites misuse. Implementing user accounts and roles protects sensitive operations while keeping routine tasks accessible.

## Authentication Options
- **Session‑based login** with username and password stored on the server.
- **OAuth or single sign‑on** for organizations that manage identities centrally.
- **API tokens** for automated tools invoking the same backend endpoints.

## Role Design
- Define roles such as *viewer*, *operator* and *administrator* with escalating privileges.
- Map each CLI command to the minimum role required.
- Expose role information in the UI so users understand their capabilities.

## Implementation Steps
1. Add a login screen and secure session storage using HTTP‑only cookies.
2. Protect command execution routes with middleware that checks authentication and authorization.
3. Display only the commands allowed for the current user to reduce confusion and temptation.

## Checklist
- [ ] Failed logins trigger rate limiting and audit logs.
- [ ] Session timeouts and logout controls are clearly visible.
- [ ] Role definitions and permission mappings are documented for administrators.

Proper authentication and authorization ensure that network control stays in trusted hands.
