# Stage 126: Mobile Responsiveness and Adaptive Layout

Operators may need to trigger commands from tablets or phones. The current fixed‑width layout breaks on small screens, making critical actions difficult.

## Design Goals
- Support common breakpoints (≤480px, ≤768px, ≥1024px).
- Maintain legible fonts and accessible tap targets on touch devices.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling and clipped output.

## Techniques
- Use CSS grid or flexbox with percentage widths and min/max constraints.
- Apply media queries to rearrange panels into a single column on narrow screens.
- Employ responsive tables that collapse into card layouts when necessary.

## Testing
1. Preview the interface in device emulators and on physical hardware.
2. Verify that orientation changes do not lose state or cut off controls.
3. Confirm that performance remains acceptable over mobile networks.

## Checklist
- [ ] Layout adapts cleanly at 320px wide.
- [ ] Tap targets are at least 44×44 px with adequate spacing.
- [ ] No content requires horizontal scrolling on small devices.

Responsive design ensures the CLI panel is usable wherever operators happen to be.
