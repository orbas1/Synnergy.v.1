# GUIs

Synnergy ships lightweight web interfaces that interact with the CLI.  The
wallet GUI (Stage 31) generates encrypted wallets and queries balances.  Stage
32 introduces an Explorer GUI that issues read-only CLI RPC calls to display
blockchain state such as chain height and block details.  These tools provide a
foundation for richer dashboards and can be extended to visualise transactions,
addresses and node health.
