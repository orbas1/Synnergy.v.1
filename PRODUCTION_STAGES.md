# Production Readiness Plan

This document outlines a 20-stage roadmap for reorganizing the repository and preparing it for production-grade deployment. The stages can be executed in parallel by separate teams but are ordered to show overall dependencies.

1. **Establish Module Boundaries**  
   - Audit existing packages and identify domain groupings (core, nodes, tokens, cross-chain, security, etc.).  
   - Create `internal/` and `pkg/` directories to separate internal code from reusable libraries.

2. **Relocate Domain Packages**  
   - Move node-related code into `internal/nodes/` with subpackages per node type.  
   - Group token implementations under `internal/tokens/`.  
   - Update import paths accordingly.

3. **Create `cmd/` Entrypoints**  
   - Maintain a dedicated `cmd/` directory for all binaries (e.g., node, tooling).  
   - Each binary receives its own subdirectory with a `main.go` entrypoint.

4. **Introduce Dependency Management**  
   - Use Go modules (already present) with versioned releases.  
   - Pin external dependencies and enable automatic updates via Dependabot or Renovate.

5. **Implement Configuration Management**  
   - Centralize configuration logic under `internal/config/`.  
   - Support environment variables and configuration files (YAML/JSON) with validation.

6. **Logging and Instrumentation**
   - Standardize structured logging across the codebase using a high-performance library such as `zap` or `logrus`.
   - Create an `internal/log` package that wraps the chosen logger and exposes helper functions for common patterns.
   - Ensure every package obtains loggers via dependency injection or context and avoid global state.
   - Define log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) and allow them to be configured through configuration files and environment variables.
   - Emit logs in JSON format with timestamps, component names, and keyâ€“value pairs to ease parsing by log aggregators.
   - Include correlation IDs and request context in log entries to enable end-to-end tracing of operations.
   - Support multiple log sinks (stdout, rotating files, and remote endpoints like ELK/Loki/Splunk) with pluggable backends.
   - Provide log rotation, retention policies, and size limits for long-running services.
   - Document usage guidelines so new modules follow consistent logging practices.
   - Instrument application metrics using Prometheus, exposing a `/metrics` HTTP endpoint.
   - Capture counters, gauges, and histograms for key operations (transaction throughput, block processing latency, resource utilization, error rates).
   - Export standard Go runtime metrics and add custom collectors where necessary.
   - Supply starter Grafana dashboards and alerting rules for common metrics.
   - Add health and readiness probes backed by metrics to integrate with orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
   - Write unit tests verifying that the logging facade initializes correctly and that metrics are registered without conflict.

7. **Error Handling and Observability**  
   - Standardize error types and wrapping using `errors` package.  
   - Introduce tracing with OpenTelemetry for cross-service visibility.

8. **Security Hardening**  
   - Add static analysis tools (`gosec`, `staticcheck`).  
   - Enforce code scanning in CI and address findings.  
   - Perform dependency vulnerability scans.

9. **Testing Framework**  
   - Achieve high unit-test coverage for all packages.  
   - Add integration tests for cross-chain and token flows.  
   - Use GitHub Actions to run tests on each push.

10. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
    - Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests, lints, and packages binaries.  
    - Enable caching for modules and test results to speed up builds.

11. **Documentation Standardization**  
    - Move guides into a `docs/` directory.  
    - Use a documentation generator (e.g., MkDocs) to produce a docs site.  
    - Maintain ADRs for architectural decisions.

12. **API and RPC Layer**  
    - Define gRPC/REST interfaces for node communication.  
    - Use protobuf definitions under `api/` and auto-generate stubs.

13. **Configuration of Build Tags and Environments**  
    - Use build tags for optional features (e.g., experimental nodes).  
    - Provide separate configs for dev/test/production environments.

14. **Containerization**  
    - Create Dockerfiles for each binary.  
    - Use multi-stage builds for minimal runtime images.  
    - Provide a `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration.

15. **Release Management**  
    - Adopt semantic versioning.  
    - Automate release notes and changelog generation.  
    - Sign releases and provide checksums.

16. **Performance Benchmarking**  
    - Add Go benchmarks for critical paths.  
    - Establish performance baselines and set budgets.  
    - Monitor regressions in CI.

17. **Persistence and State Management**  
    - Abstract database interactions into interfaces.  
    - Support multiple backends (e.g., Postgres, LevelDB).  
    - Add migration tooling.

18. **Networking and P2P Layer**  
    - Encapsulate networking code under `internal/p2p/`.  
    - Support secure transports (TLS, Noise protocol) and peer discovery.

19. **Governance and Access Control**  
    - Centralize RBAC logic in `internal/auth/`.  
    - Implement policy enforcement and audit logging.

20. **Packaging and Distribution**  
    - Provide install scripts and homebrew formulas.  
    - Publish Docker images and binary tarballs for supported platforms.

These stages, once completed, will transition the repository from a prototype into a maintainable, production-grade codebase suitable for enterprise deployment.
