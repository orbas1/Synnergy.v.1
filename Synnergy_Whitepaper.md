## Market Landscape
Synnergy operates within a rapidly evolving blockchain industry where institutions demand interoperability, regulatory alignment and sustainable performance. Legacy networks often struggle with siloed design, opaque governance and limited cross-chain capabilities. Synnergy addresses these gaps by offering a modular architecture with built-in compliance and adaptive consensus mechanisms.
## Launch and Community Ownership
Synnergy Network is released under a philosophy of full decentralisation. Upon mainnet launch, Blackridge Group Ltd. relinquishes operational control and ceases active management of the project. All code, infrastructure and documentation are delivered "as is" for the community to maintain, fork or extend at its discretion. Upgrades, bug fixes and governance decisions are expected to arise from community consensus rather than a centralised team.
Internal development and charity wallets remain operational for business continuity, while the creator retains the option to relinquish their fee share through the signed CLI mechanism described below.
## Security and Performance Assurance
Before the network is handed to the community, the codebase and infrastructure undergo extensive security and performance reviews. Independent audits, static analysis and penetration testing evaluate consensus algorithms, smart‑contract modules and network interfaces to surface vulnerabilities. Comprehensive benchmarking measures throughput, latency and resource consumption across reference deployments. Findings are used to optimise parameters and eliminate bottlenecks, providing a hardened baseline for community‑led evolution.

## Creator Distribution Control
Internal development and charity wallets are retained to support ongoing business operations. A dedicated creator wallet and an internal charity wallet each receive a share of transaction fees. In a future update, the creator may sign a CLI transaction with the creator private key to permanently disable their 1% allocation. When invoked, this function redirects the creator portion to node hosts, preserving overall economics while transitioning fee flows entirely to the community.

### Overview
### Layered System Design
#### Network and Consensus Layer
The network employs a hybrid consensus engine combining PoW, PoS and PoH. Weights for each algorithm adjust independently based on live demand and stake distribution, allowing the chain to favour the most efficient mechanism without manual intervention.

Validator selection uses a verifiable random function seeded by the previous block hash. Every node derives the same winner, removing nondeterminism and ensuring fair rotation.

A lightweight BFT voting round finalizes blocks once two thirds of validators approve, after which PoW sealing prevents forks.

### Validator Governance, Stake Economics and Quorum
### Stake Penalties and Slashing
Misbehaving validators are penalized through stake reduction with accompanying evidence logs. Recorded proofs of offences propagate across the network so slashes are enforced consistently and auditable by anyone.
Conversely, validators that contribute sub-blocks to finalized blocks receive automatic stake rewards. The consensus engine credits these rewards immediately upon finality, reinforcing honest participation and long‑term network security.

| Node hosts                   | 5% (6% when creator share disabled) |
| Creator wallet               | 1% (optional) |
Distribution contracts can credit these shares directly to ledger accounts via `FeeDistributionContract`. Should the creator disable their allocation, subsequent distributions automatically route the 1% to node hosts. For bespoke arrangements—such as side agreements between validators—`ShareProportional` accepts weightings and reconciles rounding remainders so every unit of value is accounted for.
### Central Banks
### Community Needs
Network fees are automatically split between development, charitable reserves, the LoanPool, validator rewards and other stakeholders. Five percent of every fee supports internal development, with a further five percent each directed to internal and external charities; ten percent is reserved for the LoanPool, five percent for passive income programs, fifty‑nine percent for validators and miners, and the remainder for authority nodes, node hosts and the creator wallet【F:core/fees.go†L101-L128】. The creator may later execute the CLI function to surrender this final 1% share, after which node hosts receive the redistributed portion. Deterministic genesis wallet addresses are generated by hashing human‑readable labels, allowing any observer to recompute the addresses that receive these distributions from the first block onward【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L22-L58】.
