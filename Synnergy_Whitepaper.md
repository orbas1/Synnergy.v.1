## Technical Architecture

# Technical Architecture

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network is built as a modular blockchain platform combining flexible consensus, a programmable virtual machine, AI-enhanced smart contracts, cross-chain interoperability, and rigorous security. This document details the architectural layers and core components underlying the system.

## Layered System Design
### Network and Consensus Layer
The network utilises a dynamic hybrid consensus engine that balances proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake and proof‑of‑history through configurable weightings. Parameters such as Alpha, Beta and Gamma govern thresholds while availability flags allow algorithms to be toggled without code changes【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L52】. A smoothing routine normalises weights and clamps them above a minimum floor to maintain liveness under changing demand or stake concentrations【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L88】. To complement this weighting system, a ConsensusHopper observes live throughput, latency and validator counts and seamlessly switches between proof modes when thresholds are met【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L29】【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L70】.

### Cross‑Chain Interoperability
A dedicated CrossChainManager registers bridges between external networks, tracks authorised relayers and exposes APIs for listing or retrieving bridge configurations【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L48】. Global relayer whitelists can be updated atomically, enabling or revoking access across all bridges in one operation【F:cross_chain.go†L70-L90】.
Bridge operations are tracked through a BridgeTransferManager that locks assets and records claims so deposits and releases remain auditable across networks【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L48】【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L52-L67】. A ConnectionManager maintains the lifecycle of inter-chain links, marking openings and closures with timestamps for historical tracing【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L47】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L45-L58】. For asset movements, a TransactionManager logs lock‑and‑mint or burn‑and‑release flows and exposes queries to list or retrieve transactions by identifier【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L48】【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L50-L88】.

Protocol standards are catalogued in a chain‑agnostic registry so new cross‑network formats can be adopted without touching bridge code. Each entry receives a unique identifier and can be queried or enumerated to negotiate capabilities with external chains【F:cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go†L10-L45】. Complementing this, a cross‑chain contract registry maps local contract addresses to their remote counterparts and supports updates or removals as integrations evolve【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L5-L50】.

To support off‑chain scaling, a SidechainRegistry tracks side networks, their latest headers and validator sets while allowing administrators to pause, resume or update validator lists as governance demands change【F:core/sidechains.go†L8-L120】. A PlasmaBridge exposes deposit and exit routines that let users safely migrate assets between the base chain and plasma sidechains, recording exit nonces and finalisation status for auditability【F:core/plasma_operations.go†L5-L40】. For lightweight participants a LightNode retains only block headers, enabling quick verification of chain progress without maintaining a full ledger copy【F:core/light_node.go†L5-L28】.

### Virtual Machine and Smart Contracts
Synnergy ships with a lightweight SimpleVM that interprets 24‑bit opcodes and supports resource‑constrained profiles. Instances scale from heavy nodes to super‑light deployments while shared handlers and concurrency limiters enforce deterministic execution【F:virtual_machine.go†L11-L38】【F:virtual_machine.go†L49-L79】. During execution the VM slices bytecode into opcodes, meters gas per operation and halts on errors or exceeded limits【F:virtual_machine.go†L121-L178】.

Contract governance is handled by a ContractManager that can transfer ownership, pause or resume execution and upgrade deployed bytecode while preserving metadata【F:contract_management.go†L5-L70】. For AI‑driven workflows an AIContractRegistry layers model hashes over the base registry and exposes inference-specific invocation paths【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L8-L49】.

Sandboxed execution environments add another safety layer. The SandboxManager provisions isolated sandboxes with explicit gas and memory ceilings, supports lifecycle operations and tracks timestamps for auditing【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L51】【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L53-L105】.

### Language Compatibility and Opcode Catalogue
The Synnergy VM accepts contracts authored in multiple languages—ranging from WASM and Golang to Solidity and Python—and verifies support through a compatibility list that can be queried by tooling or deployment scripts【F:contract_language_compatibility.go†L5-L27】. Execution semantics are standardised by a comprehensive opcode table that maps every exposed function to a deterministic 24‑bit code, ensuring compiled contracts can invoke system utilities consistently across upgrades【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L1-L33】.

### Fee Management and Gas Tracking
To keep transaction costs predictable, Synnergy maintains a GasTable mapping opcode names to base fees and loading pricing data from reference tables at startup【F:gas_table.go†L13-L46】. The loader caches parsed values and falls back to a default cost when an opcode is missing or malformed【F:gas_table.go†L47-L75】. Utilities allow runtime registration or resetting of gas prices so administrators can surface new operations and refresh pricing without restarting nodes【F:gas_table.go†L77-L107】.

### AI Integration and Data Intelligence
Synnergy's AI stack includes a marketplace for trading models, drift detection to maintain accuracy, and encrypted storage for model assets. The ModelMarketplace registers listings and enforces ownership rules, enabling dynamic updates and removals【F:ai_model_management.go†L9-L98】. DriftMonitor tracks performance metrics against stored baselines and flags deviations beyond configurable thresholds【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】. Model artifacts are protected through AES‑GCM encryption using the SecureStorage service【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L12-L44】【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L47-L75】. TrainingManager orchestrates dataset‑driven jobs, tracking their lifecycle and supporting cancellation or completion of running tasks【F:ai_training.go†L10-L49】【F:ai_training.go†L71-L86】. An InferenceEngine loads model artifacts, executes deterministic runs and analyses batches of transactions for fraud scores to surface high‑risk activity【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L9-L53】.

### Data Distribution and Storage
Content distribution is coordinated by the DataDistribution registry, which maps datasets to serving nodes and prunes entries when offerings are revoked, ensuring up‑to‑date location metadata for clients【F:data_distribution.go†L5-L72】. Applications can publish real‑time feeds via DataFeed objects that support atomic updates and snapshots for auditability【F:data_operations.go†L8-L69】. Larger binaries are managed with the DataResourceManager, which tracks byte usage and returns isolated copies to callers【F:data_resource_management.go†L5-L66】. ContentNetworkNode instances maintain per‑node catalogs of hosted assets, enabling discovery and deregistration as resources appear or retire【F:content_node.go†L5-L55】.

### Node Services and Availability
The FailoverManager tracks node heartbeats and promotes backups whenever primaries miss timeouts, delivering automatic recovery across clusters【F:high_availability.go†L8-L45】. IndexingNode instances cache ledger data in-memory for rapid retrieval through thread‑safe insert, query and delete operations【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L27】. StakingNode maintains per-address stakes and total locked value, supporting lightweight staking flows without a full ledger backend【F:staking_node.go†L5-L27】【F:staking_node.go†L39-L47】. A controlled Faucet service dispenses limited test funds, enforcing per‑address cooldowns and configurable withdrawal limits to prevent abuse【F:faucet.go†L9-L38】.

### Specialized Node Types
Beyond core validators, the network supports specialised roles. EnergyEfficientNode instances generate sustainability certificates and report efficiency and carbon offsets for green-compliance deployments【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L80】. EnvironmentalMonitoringNode evaluates sensor feeds against threshold conditions to trigger on-chain actions【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L65】. GeospatialNode retains location histories for tracked subjects【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L46】, while MobileMiningNode throttles mining on battery-powered devices when charge drops below configured levels【F:mobile_mining_node.go†L8-L64】.

### Security and Compliance Services
A built‑in Firewall maintains block lists for wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs, allowing nodes to enforce network rules with thread‑safe operations for adding, removing or enumerating restrictions【F:firewall.go†L5-L44】. IdentityService captures user metadata and verification logs, guarding registration against duplicates and recording each verification attempt for compliance audits【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】【F:identity_verification.go†L60-L75】. A RegulatoryManager catalogs jurisdictional rules and checks transactions against maximum allowed amounts, returning any policy identifiers that are breached【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L25】【F:regulatory_management.go†L27-L74】. Role-based authorization is enforced through an AccessController that grants or revokes roles per address and exposes queries for permission checks【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】【F:access_control.go†L50-L62】. The ComplianceManager tracks suspensions and whitelists and reviews transactions against these policies before propagation【F:compliance_management.go†L15-L104】. Validators are subject to the StakePenaltyManager, which adjusts stake balances and records penalty history for misbehavior【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L61】. RegulatoryNode deployments work alongside the manager to approve or flag transactions, logging rule violations per address for audit trails【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L43】. For high-assurance operations, a BiometricSecurityNode couples nodes with template-based verification, gating sensitive functions behind enrolled biometric signatures【F:biometric_security_node.go†L1-L37】【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】.
Supplementary hardening modules underpin these services. An Encryptor and KeyManager provide basic key rotation primitives for symmetric encryption【F:internal/security/encryption.go†L4-L19】【F:internal/security/key_management.go†L5-L22】, while a SecretsManager stores sensitive configuration values in memory and now validates key usage via a simple CLI【F:internal/security/secrets_manager.go†L3-L39】. A PatchManager records applied updates for audit purposes【F:internal/security/patch_manager.go†L3-L15】. RateLimiter and DDoSMitigator components throttle requests and block abusive peers to protect network resources【F:internal/security/rate_limiter.go†L5-L18】【F:internal/security/ddos_mitigation.go†L3-L15】.

### Privacy and Zero‑Trust Channels
The PrivateTxManager pools encrypted payloads using AES‑GCM and provides retrieval only to authorised parties【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L46】【F:private_transactions.go†L55-L74】. For escrowed communications the ZeroTrustEngine opens channels with ephemeral Ed25519 keys, signs ciphertext and verifies signatures before decryption【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L47】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L50-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L101】.

### Observability and Operational Insight
WatchtowerNode instances monitor the network, gathering system health metrics and reporting forks via dedicated logging routines【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L52】. Metrics are sourced from a SystemHealthLogger that samples runtime statistics and exposes snapshots for dashboards or automation【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】. An EnergyEfficiencyTracker logs per-validator throughput and electricity consumption to calculate transactions per kilowatt hour and network averages【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】.

### Analytics and Predictive Services
An AnomalyDetector streams metrics and applies a z‑score threshold to surface outliers in real time, updating running mean and variance for each observation【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. For forward‑looking insights, the financial forecasting library offers moving‑average, linear‑regression and autoregressive models to project asset prices across multiple months【F:financial_prediction.go†L7-L107】.

### Transaction and Wallet Foundations
Core transaction objects capture sender and recipient addresses, amounts, fees and nonces while optionally embedding bytecode programs and biometric hashes to tie payments to verified identities【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L35】【F:core/transaction.go†L56-L95】. Wallets generate ECDSA key pairs, derive deterministic addresses and can sign, verify or securely persist private keys using scrypt‑derived AES‑GCM encryption【F:core/wallet.go†L19-L56】【F:core/wallet.go†L71-L150】. Genesis wallet allocations seed ecosystem funds and a helper routine distributes fees across internal development, charity and validator pools at network genesis【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L58】.

### Client and Wallet Services
A lightweight wallet service exposes HTTP endpoints for health checks and deterministic wallet creation, enabling external platforms to provision addresses programmatically. The server wires request handlers and logs events for operational visibility【F:walletserver/handlers.go†L5-L29】【F:walletserver/main.go†L9-L18】.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
Blackridge Group Ltd. distributes official container images through a multistage Docker build that packages both the node and wallet server binaries【F:docker/Dockerfile†L3-L25】. Production clusters can be orchestrated with the provided Kubernetes deployment manifest, which defines resource limits, health probes and service exposure for Synnergy nodes【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L71】. For cloud environments, Terraform modules provision VPC networking, security groups and an autoscaling group to roll out fault-tolerant nodes across availability zones【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L104】.

## Conclusion
Through this layered architecture, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a resilient, extensible and secure foundation for decentralised applications. The Synnergy Network integrates adaptive consensus, a programmable execution environment, AI-aware contracts and comprehensive governance tooling to support both enterprise and community deployments.

## Advanced Consensus

# Advanced Consensus

## Overview of the Blackridge Hybrid Model
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network employs a hybrid consensus engine that blends proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), and proof-of-history (PoH). Each mechanism carries a configurable weight, enabling responsive rebalancing as conditions shift. The engine boots with a 40/30/30 distribution and surfaces tunable coefficients \(Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Dmax, Smax\) alongside availability and reward toggles so operators can throttle or suspend mechanisms without code changes【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L52】【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】. The threshold function combines demand and stake concentration to guide these adjustments【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L59】.

## Configurable Parameters and Threshold Calculus
`NewSynnergyConsensus` seeds the engine with explicit coefficients—Alpha and Beta weight demand and stake in the threshold equation, Gamma governs smoothing, and Dmax/Smax normalise input ranges【F:core/consensus.go†L22-L52】. These parameters underpin the `Threshold` and `AdjustWeights` routines, enabling deterministic recalculation as network metrics evolve【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L89】. Administrators can therefore fine‑tune responsiveness, trading stability against agility while maintaining predictable behaviour.

## Genesis Bootstrapping and Initial Weights
Genesis creation credits the founder wallet with the initial five‑million Synthron allocation and mines the first block before any live traffic is processed, establishing the ledger and circulating supply【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】【F:core/coin.go†L6-L16】. `InitGenesis` snapshots the starting consensus weights so early participants can audit the launch state, all derived from `NewSynnergyConsensus` and its default 40/30/30 profile【F:core/consensus.go†L38-L52】.

## Reward and Availability Controls
`SetAvailability` and `SetPoWRewards` permit runtime enabling or disabling of specific algorithms and their incentives. This allows Blackridge operators to retire a consensus path once rewards are exhausted or maintenance is required, without altering other weightings【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】.

## Adaptive Weighting and Thresholds
The consensus engine recalculates weights as the network evolves. `AdjustWeights` applies a gamma‑scaled smoothing term and clamps values to a 7.5 per cent floor via a helper to prevent starvation, after which remaining weights are renormalised【F:core/consensus.go†L61-L89】【F:core/consensus.go†L209-L218】. Transition logic decomposes demand, security threats and stake concentration into `Tload`, `Tsecurity` and `Tstake`, recombining them into a single `TransitionThreshold` that drives reconfiguration decisions【F:core/consensus.go†L91-L119】. An `AdaptiveManager` wraps these calculations in mutexes for safe concurrent access【F:core/consensus_adaptive_management.go†L5-L47】.

## Dynamic Consensus Hopping
To avoid single‑mechanism bottlenecks, the `ConsensusHopper` samples `NetworkMetrics`—transactions per second, latency and active validator count—and uses them to jump between modes【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L70】. Throughput above 1,000 TPS with sub‑second latency biases selection toward PoS, fewer than ten validators prioritises PoH, and all other states fall back to PoW. Operators can override or query behaviour through `SetMode`, `Mode` and `LastMetrics`, all guarded by a read–write mutex so external callers observe consistent state without race conditions【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L36-L55】.

## Mode Switching and Specialised Nodes
The `ConsensusSwitcher` collates weights into a map and selects the highest value, continuously tracking the dominant mode for general‑purpose nodes【F:core/consensus_specific.go†L15-L45】. It exposes the last evaluated mode via `Mode`, enabling external components to poll the current selection without recomputation【F:core/consensus_specific.go†L48-L50】. For infrastructure that must operate under a single algorithm, `ConsensusSpecificNode` invokes `configure` to toggle availability flags and replace weights with an exclusive value, yielding specialised PoW, PoS or PoH nodes for targeted environments【F:core/consensus_specific_node.go†L3-L31】.

## Validator Governance, Stake Economics and Quorum
`ValidatorNode` bundles a base node with `ValidatorManager` and `QuorumTracker` so governance logic remains centralised【F:core/validator_node.go†L5-L47】. Nodes can `AddValidator`, `RemoveValidator` or `SlashValidator` through thin wrappers that update both the stake map and quorum counters【F:core/validator_node.go†L19-L44】. `ValidatorManager` enforces minimum stake, deletes entrants who fall short and exposes `Eligible` and `Stake` accessors for external audits【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L28-L84】. `QuorumTracker` records join and leave events, counting participants and signalling when the threshold for ratification is met【F:core/quorum_tracker.go†L5-L47】. Economic parameters for minimum stake and lock‑up duration can be derived using helper functions that reference transaction volume, reward rate and volatility【F:core/coin.go†L63-L80】.

## Stake Penalties and Slashing
Beyond automatic slashing, operators can apply explicit penalties for misbehaviour. `StakePenaltyManager` maintains stake balances, penalty tallies and an immutable history of timestamped `PenaltyRecord` entries, while `AdjustStake` lets authorities restitute or deduct collateral as needed【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L61】. The `Info` method exposes current stake, total points and full history for auditing purposes【F:stake_penalty.go†L56-L61】. These penalties interact with the `ValidatorManager`, which halves the stake of slashed validators and excludes them from future selection【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L54-L63】.

## Difficulty Regulation and PoW Mining
A sliding‑window `DifficultyManager` stores recent block times and recomputes the target difficulty after each sample, delegating to the engine's `DifficultyAdjust` to keep production aligned with expectations【F:core/consensus_difficulty.go†L5-L41】【F:core/consensus.go†L121-L128】. Each invocation of `AddSample` appends the latest block duration, prunes entries beyond the configured window and averages the remainder before requesting a new difficulty target. Operators can inspect the current value through `Difficulty` and even reconfigure the manager's window, initial difficulty or target rate at runtime【F:core/consensus_difficulty.go†L16-L39】. Mining itself uses a straightforward SHA‑256 loop for leading zeros, updating the block header once a valid nonce is discovered【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L206】. Blackridge ships a dedicated CLI module that exposes these hooks so operators can feed samples and adjust parameters without touching code【F:cli/consensus_difficulty.go†L11-L67】.

## Cross-Consensus Network Scaling
Interoperability between heterogeneous chains is handled by the `ConsensusNetworkManager`, which assigns each link an auto‑incremented ID and retains configurations in a thread‑safe map. Networks can be registered, enumerated, queried or removed, returning explicit errors if an identifier is unknown and allowing Blackridge deployments to span multiple protocol families【F:core/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L22-L69】.

## Operational Service Layer
The `ConsensusService` runs the mining or validation loop in a background routine. A telemetry span wraps each iteration, while an atomic flag prevents duplicate starts and a dedicated quit channel enables graceful shutdown through context cancellation or explicit stop signals【F:core/consensus_start.go†L23-L53】. `Stop` resets the flag and replaces the quit channel so services can be restarted cleanly, and `Info` exposes current height and runtime status for monitoring dashboards【F:core/consensus_start.go†L47-L61】.

## Observability and Interface Abstraction
Every consensus node can be wrapped in a `NodeAdapter`, which bridges the native `Node` to the generic `nodes.NodeInterface`. The adapter embeds a `BaseNode` keyed by the node ID, exposing uniform methods for start, stop and messaging while delegating consensus specifics to the wrapped instance【F:core/node_adapter.go†L5-L16】. This abstraction allows Blackridge's tooling—such as wallets, explorers or monitoring agents—to interact with consensus nodes without binding to internal implementations.

## Virtual Machine Opcode Integration
Synnergy's virtual machine enumerates dedicated opcodes for consensus components, allowing smart contracts to drive dynamic mode hopping, manage PoW difficulty or administer validators directly within execution flows【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L84-L88】【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L561-L568】. Contracts can invoke `dynamic_consensus_hopping_Evaluate`, call the difficulty manager or even register and slash validators through VM instructions, enabling on‑chain automation without privileged off‑chain actors.

## CLI Exposure and Runtime Tuning
The command‑line suite mirrors engine capabilities, providing subcommands to mine test blocks, inspect or adjust weights, compute thresholds, evaluate full transition heuristics, toggle availability flags or enable and disable rewards【F:cli/consensus.go†L15-L180】. Dedicated options such as `mine`, `weights`, `adjust`, `threshold`, `transition`, `difficulty`, `availability` and `powrewards` let operators exercise every consensus hook from the terminal. A companion `consensus-difficulty` module lets operators submit block‑time samples, query the latest difficulty or reinitialise the manager with new parameters【F:cli/consensus_difficulty.go†L11-L67】.

## Security and Fairness Mechanisms
Fair validator selection is achieved through a weighted random algorithm that discards sets where the largest stakeholder exceeds half of the total, preventing dominant validators from monopolising rewards【F:core/consensus.go†L144-L178】. `ValidateSubBlock` confirms that each sub‑block carries transactions and a valid signature before inclusion, ensuring only authenticated validators influence the ledger【F:core/consensus.go†L180-L188】. `WatchtowerNode` instances continuously collect system metrics, enforce firewall policies and report detected forks, providing an external check on consensus behaviour and highlighting chain splits for remediation【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L86】. Quorum tracking further enforces fairness by ratifying decisions only when the requisite number of validators are active【F:core/quorum_tracker.go†L5-L47】.

## Summary
Through a synthesis of adaptive weighting, dynamic hopping, specialised nodes, rigorous validator governance, and cross-consensus networking, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a resilient and versatile consensus layer for the Synnergy Network. This design enables the platform to maintain performance and security across diverse deployment scenarios while remaining agile in the face of evolving market conditions and threat landscapes.

## Ai

# Artificial Intelligence

## Strategic Vision
Blackridge Group Ltd. embeds artificial intelligence at the core of the Synnergy Network to deliver predictive insight, autonomous optimisation and a self‑service model economy. The AI stack operates within a privacy‑preserving, decentralised environment while satisfying enterprise governance requirements.

## AI Service Layer
The `AIService` orchestrates prediction utilities and model commerce through concurrency‑safe registries backed by read‑write mutexes【F:ai.go†L32-L38】.
- **PredictFraud** ingests transaction payloads and derives a deterministic fraud probability by hashing the JSON bytes【F:ai.go†L50-L58】.
- **OptimiseBaseFee** reviews average gas prices to recommend the next block’s base fee【F:ai.go†L60-L67】.
- **ForecastVolume** scales recent transaction counts to project near‑term network activity【F:ai.go†L70-L77】.
Model metadata captures royalty percentages and publish timestamps so creators are compensated whenever analytics are invoked【F:ai.go†L13-L19】【F:ai.go†L80-L92】.

## Model Marketplace and Escrow
Enterprise participants monetise models through the `ModelMarketplace`, which tracks listings, owners and dynamic pricing with thread‑safe maps【F:ai_model_management.go†L19-L24】【F:ai_model_management.go†L31-L45】. Listings can be enumerated, updated or removed by the seller to reflect evolving commercial terms【F:ai_model_management.go†L56-L98】. Purchases deposit funds into an escrow ledger, while rentals set an expiry window before releasing payment; escrows are cleared atomically once the seller claims funds【F:ai.go†L108-L151】【F:ai.go†L153-L164】.

## Training Lifecycle Orchestration
The `TrainingManager` coordinates model development pipelines using guarded job registries【F:ai_training.go†L20-L24】. Operators can start jobs by providing dataset and model identifiers【F:ai_training.go†L32-L49】, query status or enumerate all jobs for auditability【F:ai_training.go†L52-L69】, and cancel or complete work while recording terminal timestamps for governance【F:ai_training.go†L71-L103】.

## Inference Engine and Fraud Analysis
The `InferenceEngine` loads model binaries and returns deterministic output hashes for reproducible decisioning【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L15-L43】. A batch `Analyse` method produces per‑transaction fraud scores, enabling automated compliance across large datasets【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L45-L53】.

## Continuous Monitoring
### Drift Monitoring
`DriftMonitor` maintains baseline metrics and reports deviations exceeding a configurable threshold to highlight model decay before it impacts production【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.
### Anomaly Detection
An `AnomalyDetector` performs streaming z‑score checks over operational signals, defaulting to a threshold of three standard deviations to minimise false positives【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Secure Model Storage
`SecureStorage` protects artefacts with AES‑GCM encryption. Keys must be 32 bytes, nonces are randomly generated and ciphertext is stored only after successful sealing, ensuring confidentiality and integrity on retrieval【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L23-L44】【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L47-L75】.

## AI‑Enhanced Smart Contracts
The `AIContractRegistry` layers AI metadata over the base contract registry, mapping each deployment to the model hash governing its inference logic【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L8-L35】. Contracts expose a dedicated `infer` entry point invoked through `InvokeAIContract`, allowing on‑chain transactions to trigger model evaluation within the virtual machine【F:ai_enhanced_contract.go†L39-L46】.

## Financial Forecasting Utilities
A common `PriceModel` interface supports multiple predictors—simple moving averages, linear regression and AR(1)—all available through `ForecastSeries`, which defaults to a three‑point moving average when no model is specified【F:financial_prediction.go†L7-L107】. These tools help authority nodes project revenue and plan liquidity months in advance.

## Quality Assurance
End‑to‑end tests exercise prediction APIs, marketplace flows, training controls, inference operations, drift and anomaly detection and secure storage to guarantee deterministic behaviour across modules【F:ai_modules_test.go†L8-L142】.

## Enterprise Governance and Branding
Every AI capability is engineered under Blackridge Group Ltd.’s commitment to responsible innovation. Royalty tracking, auditable job metadata and encrypted model handling demonstrate how the platform aligns powerful machine intelligence with transparent governance and monetisation.

## Conclusion
By coupling predictive engines, lifecycle management, continuous monitoring and AI‑aware smart contracts, the Synnergy Network delivers a unified framework for secure, accountable artificial intelligence. Blackridge clients can deploy, monetise and evolve models directly within the blockchain ecosystem while maintaining rigorous operational control.

## Authority Nodes

# Authority Nodes

## Introduction
Authority nodes form the governance backbone of the Synnergy Network, providing policy enforcement, regulatory compliance, and rapid dispute resolution. Operated and maintained by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, the authority layer safeguards the network while upholding decentralisation principles. These nodes oversee sensitive operations, perform identity checks, and authorise exceptional actions such as transaction reversals.

## Architecture Overview
Enterprise deployments demand predictable behaviour and strict auditability. Synnergy therefore implements authority nodes as a layered service:

- **Thread-safe core** – Each registry operation is protected by read–write locks, ensuring concurrent registration and voting without race conditions【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L34-L129】.
- **Indexed lookups** – A dedicated `AuthorityNodeIndex` maps addresses to node records and exposes snapshot and JSON methods for deterministic state replication across clients【F:core/authority_node_index.go†L8-L67】.
- **Modular extensions** – Specialised structures such as elected and government nodes embed the base `AuthorityNode` type, allowing policy‑specific behaviour while reusing shared mechanics【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

## Governance Responsibilities
Authority nodes serve several critical governance functions:

- **Policy enforcement:** Nodes can freeze or reverse transactions during fraud investigations while maintaining auditable trails.
- **Identity verification:** Before sensitive actions are approved, authority nodes validate participants using multi-factor and biometric checks.
- **Network oversight:** They monitor banking nodes, compliance modules, and cross-chain bridges to ensure protocol adherence and regulatory alignment.
- **Dispute arbitration:** Nodes convene to adjudicate contested transactions and resource allocations, producing on-chain records of their decisions.

## Authority Node Registry
All authority nodes are tracked in a canonical registry that supports registration, voting, and information retrieval. The registry exposes methods to:

- **Register or deregister nodes** while preventing duplicates【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L45-L55】【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L124-L129】.
- **Cast and withdraw votes** through `Vote` and `RemoveVote`, maintaining a map of approving voters per candidate【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L57-L76】.
- **Query membership and metadata** via `IsAuthorityNode`, `Info`, and `List` for downstream services and audits【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L98-L122】.

The accompanying index provides constant‑time retrieval and safe snapshots for off‑chain analytics or checkpointing【F:core/authority_node_index.go†L8-L63】.

## Voting and Electorate Mechanics
Beyond simple vote tallying, the registry can derive a representative electorate. `Electorate` orders candidates by vote count, shuffles ties to avoid bias, and returns a deterministically sized slice for consensus operations【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L78-L95】. This mechanism enables quorum selection for tasks such as transaction reversals or policy ratification.

## Node Types
Synnergy distinguishes between multiple authority node categories to balance power and accountability. Categories include elected, government, central banking, banking, regulator, creditor, and military nodes:

### Elected Authority Nodes
Community-elected nodes hold privileges for a fixed term. The implementation records a term end timestamp and exposes an `IsActive` check to enforce expiration【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】.

### Government Authority Nodes
Government-operated nodes participate in compliance processes but intentionally lack capabilities to mint native tokens or adjust monetary policy, preserving separation of duties【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

### Central Banking Authority Nodes
Central banks operate dedicated nodes that manage CBDC issuance while safeguarding the fixed SYN supply. `CentralBankingNode` embeds monetary policy metadata and a SYN10 token interface, enabling policy updates and controlled token minting without altering native coin supply【F:core/central_banking_node.go†L9-L37】.

### Banking Authority Nodes
Institutional banking nodes coordinate registered financial entities. The `BankInstitutionalNode` maintains a thread-safe registry of participating institutions, allowing banks to join or withdraw and exposing snapshots for audits and compliance checks【F:core/bank_institutional_node.go†L8-L33】.

### Regulator Authority Nodes
Regulator nodes enforce jurisdictional rules by evaluating transactions and flagging violations. `RegulatoryNode` pairs with a `RegulatoryManager` to approve compliant transfers and record enforcement logs for each address【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】.

### Creditor Authority Nodes
Creditor nodes administer the network's lending facilities. They steward a shared `LoanPool` treasury that accepts proposals, tallies votes, and disburses approved funds to recipients【F:core/loanpool.go†L9-L74】. Retail requests flow through `LoanPoolApply`, which records applications, tracks votes, and processes approved loans against the same pool【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L17-L63】.

### Military Authority Nodes
Military-operated nodes extend the base node with secure command execution and logistics tracking for defence assets. `WarfareNode` validates privileged commands and records asset movements to maintain operational readiness【F:core/warfare_node.go†L11-L51】.

## Application and Election Workflow
Prospective authority nodes submit on-chain applications detailing their role and description. The **AuthorityApplicationManager** assigns a sequential ID, tracks approvals and rejections, and finalises successful candidates into the registry【F:core/authority_apply.go†L11-L104】. Applications expire after a configurable TTL and are periodically purged by `Tick`, guaranteeing that stale requests do not linger【F:core/authority_apply.go†L106-L115】. Voting can be performed through CLI commands that register, vote, and list authority nodes, enabling transparent elections【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L20-L112】.

## Transaction Oversight
Authority nodes mediate transaction reversals via a structured process. `RequestReversal` freezes recipient funds, collects votes, and `FinalizeReversal` executes compensating transfers only if sufficient approvals are recorded within the 30‑day window【F:core/transaction_control.go†L52-L105】. Failed or expired requests automatically release frozen balances, ensuring fairness to all participants.

## Economic Incentives and Compliance
Authority nodes earn a predefined share of network fees. The distribution policy allocates five percent of every transaction fee to authority node operations, with the remainder routed to development, charity, validators, and other stakeholders【F:core/fees.go†L101-L128】. Rewards accrue in a dedicated genesis wallet, providing a transparent pool for compensation and infrastructure funding【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L41】. To maintain eligibility, nodes must uphold jurisdictional regulations, maintain audit logs, and demonstrate continuous uptime or risk deregistration.

## Interfaces and Tooling
Blackridge Group provides multiple interfaces for managing authority nodes:

- **CLI Suite:** Commands under `authority` and `authority_apply` allow registration, voting, application submission, and status queries, as documented in the core command overview【F:README.md†L126-L142】.
- **Authority Node Index GUI:** A TypeScript-based dashboard lists authority nodes and surfaces metadata for operators, delivering a consistent interface across environments.
- **Node Operations Dashboard:** REST endpoints exposed by authority nodes feed into system monitoring tools for real-time health and compliance metrics.

## Operational Resilience
Authority nodes leverage the network's failover framework to guarantee availability. The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and promotes the most recent backup if the primary becomes unresponsive, ensuring continuity during infrastructure outages or maintenance windows【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

## Security Considerations
To mitigate centralisation risks, authority nodes operate on hardened infrastructure with mandatory multi-factor authentication, encrypted communications, and regular key rotations. Deterministic JSON encoders across registries and applications provide tamper-evident logs for forensic review【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L22-L31】【F:core/authority_apply.go†L139-L151】. Critical actions require quorum-based approvals, and all authority operations are recorded on-chain for transparency and post‑event audits.

## Conclusion
Authority nodes, stewarded by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, balance decentralised participation with necessary oversight. Through rigorous application processes, specialised node types, and comprehensive tooling, the Synnergy Network achieves a resilient governance model capable of evolving with regulatory landscapes while protecting its users.

## Banks

# Banking Integration on the Synnergy Network

The Synnergy Network, engineered and maintained by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, is designed to meet the rigorous demands of modern financial institutions. This section outlines how banks can leverage Synnergy’s infrastructure to deliver secure digital asset services, comply with global regulations, and interoperate with both legacy and emerging financial systems.

## Strategic Value Proposition

1. **Regulatory Alignment** – Modules such as `compliance_management` and the dedicated `regulatory_node` allow institutions to map existing AML, KYC, and reporting obligations directly into on‑chain workflows.
2. **Operational Efficiency** – Smart‑contract automation and deterministic transaction fees reduce reconciliation overhead and settlement latency.
3. **Security by Design** – Zero‑trust data channels, biometric authentication, and hardware‑level wallet isolation provide multilayer protection for high‑value transactions.

## Banking Node Architecture

Synnergy defines specialised node roles to reflect the unique functions of commercial and central banks:

- **BankInstitutionalNode** – Registers and manages participating financial institutions while inheriting the full capabilities of a standard network node.
- **CentralBankingNode** – Enables monetary policy updates and supports minting of central‑bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
- **CustodialNode** – Holds digital assets on behalf of clients, implementing audited release mechanisms to ensure segregation of funds.

These abstractions ensure that each bank maintains authority over its operations while interoperating with other network participants through standardised interfaces.

## Enterprise Integration Architecture

Banks rely on entrenched core systems, messaging buses, and batch processors. Synnergy accommodates these realities through multiple integration paths:

- **API Gateways** – gRPC and REST endpoints expose ledger operations, letting middleware broker transactions without direct ledger access.
- **Message Queues** – Event streams can be routed into ISO 20022 or SWIFT translators, enabling straight-through processing for payments and settlements.
- **CLI Tooling** – Utilities such as `bank_institutional_node` and `bank_nodes_index` allow operations teams to script node provisioning, policy updates, and audit exports.

## Security and Compliance Controls

Banks operate under strict regulatory frameworks. Synnergy embeds compliance features at every layer:

- **Identity Verification** – Components such as `identity_verification` and `biometrics_auth` enable tiered KYC processes, multi‑factor authentication, and biometric enrolment.
- **Policy Enforcement** – The `compliance` and `regulatory_management` modules provide hooks for sanction screening, transaction monitoring, and automated report generation.
- **Zero‑Trust Data Channels** – Encrypted channels and granular access controls protect client data both in transit and at rest.
- **Network Defence** – The `firewall` package and `access_control` primitives block unauthorised wallets, tokens, or peer addresses at runtime.
- **Auditability** – `system_health_logging` and immutable ledger events furnish regulators with tamper-evident operational records.

## Data Governance and Privacy

Enterprise institutions must control how sensitive information is stored and shared. Synnergy provides dedicated services for data hygiene:

- **Data Resource Management** – The `data_resource_management` and `data_operations` modules track lineage and enforce retention schedules.
- **Secure Storage** – `ai_secure_storage` encrypts model artefacts and confidential datasets, ensuring only authorised personnel can retrieve them.
- **Controlled Distribution** – `data_distribution` guarantees that only verified participants receive regulated data feeds.

## Interoperability and Cross‑Chain Operations

Banks rarely operate in isolation. Synnergy’s `cross_chain` suite—covering bridges, connection managers, and transaction handlers—allows institutions to settle assets across heterogeneous ledgers without relinquishing custody. Lock‑mint and burn‑release primitives ensure auditability while minimising counter‑party risk.

## Digital Asset Issuance and Custody

Synnergy’s token frameworks let banks issue, manage, and retire digital representations of traditional assets:

- **CBDCs and Stablecoins** – The `token_syn` family and `mintCBDC` function support issuance with programmable monetary policy.
- **Asset Tokenisation** – Smart contracts allow creation of bonds, equities, or structured products, each governed by immutable rules and audit logs.
- **Custodial Services** – `custody` and `release` operations create verifiable records of assets held on behalf of clients.

## Smart Contract Automation

The network’s contract management capabilities empower banks to digitise complex financial agreements:

- **Loan and Credit Facilities** – Contracts can model interest schedules, collateral requirements, and covenant enforcement.
- **Escrow and Settlement** – Atomic settlement logic eliminates third‑party intermediaries while ensuring delivery‑versus‑payment guarantees.
- **Regulatory Hooks** – Each contract can emit structured events for real‑time compliance monitoring and audit trails.

## AI‑Driven Risk and Analytics

Blackridge Group Ltd. integrates advanced machine‑learning modules to enhance risk management:

- **Anomaly Detection** – The `anomaly_detection` service flags unusual transaction patterns, supporting fraud prevention and AML efforts.
- **Financial Prediction** – Predictive models assist treasury desks in liquidity planning and hedging strategies.
- **Model Governance** – `ai_model_management` enforces version control and reproducibility for all deployed models.
- **Drift Surveillance** – `ai_drift_monitor` alerts risk teams when production models deviate from training baselines.

## Operational Monitoring and Governance

Maintaining institutional oversight requires continuous visibility across nodes and services:

- **System Health Metrics** – `system_health_logging` aggregates runtime statistics, feeding dashboards and SIEM platforms.
- **Watchtower Services** – Dedicated `watchtower_node` processes observe network behaviour and escalate anomalies to security operations centre tooling.
- **Regulatory Dashboards** – The `regulatory_node` exposes real-time compliance status and pending filings for auditors.

## Business Continuity and Scalability

Synnergy’s architecture supports enterprise-grade resilience and throughput:

- **Automatic Failover** – `high_availability` promotes backup nodes when primaries miss heartbeats, maintaining service continuity.
- **Dynamic Consensus** – `dynamic_consensus_hopping` redistributes validator responsibilities during load spikes or attacks.
- **Energy-Efficient Modes** – `energy_efficient_node` settings tune resource consumption for cost-aware deployments.

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Assessment & Planning** – Evaluate regulatory obligations and map them to Synnergy’s compliance APIs.
2. **Node Deployment** – Instantiate a BankInstitutionalNode or CentralBankingNode with appropriate hardware security modules.
3. **Identity & Access Setup** – Configure biometric or hardware wallet authentication and register institutional participants.
4. **Pilot Programs** – Launch limited‑scope pilots for CBDC issuance or tokenised deposits, gathering metrics and stakeholder feedback.
5. **Production Scaling** – Integrate core banking systems, enable cross‑chain settlements, and automate reporting pipelines.
6. **Operational Hardening** – Connect `system_health_logging` and `watchtower_node` outputs to existing monitoring suites, and configure `high_availability` failover policies.
7. **Regulatory Automation** – Stream `regulatory_management` evaluations into internal audit systems and external supervisory portals.

## Strategic Benefits

- **Transparency** – Immutable audit trails simplify regulatory reviews and internal governance.
- **Speed** – Finality in seconds supports instant payments and real‑time gross settlement use cases.
- **Cost Reduction** – Automated reconciliation and reduced counter‑party risk lower operational expenditure.
- **Innovation** – Modular architecture allows rapid deployment of new financial products without destabilising legacy systems.

## Conclusion

By adopting the Synnergy Network, banks gain a secure, compliant, and future‑proof foundation for digital finance. Blackridge Group Ltd. provides the tooling, governance frameworks, and ongoing support necessary for institutions to embrace blockchain technology with confidence.

# Block and Sub-Blocks

> *Blackridge Group Ltd – Synnergy Network Technical Whitepaper*

## Overview
Our blockchain architecture organizes activity into **sub-blocks** that are validated through Proof of Stake (PoS) and timestamped via Proof of History (PoH). These sub-blocks are then aggregated into full **blocks**, which are sealed using Proof of Work (PoW) to finalize state across the network.

## Transaction Intake and Validator Staking
Nodes accept transactions into a mempool only after verifying that the sender possesses sufficient balance and the transaction is well‑formed【F:core/node.go†L37-L56】. Stakeholders register validator stakes through `SetStake`, which enforces a minimum bonding requirement and tracks slashed validators to exclude them from selection【F:core/node.go†L98-L115】. Misconduct such as double‑signing or downtime can be reported to slash half the validator’s stake, while `Rehabilitate` allows recovery after penalties have been addressed【F:core/node.go†L117-L138】.

## Sub-Block Formation
Sub-blocks encapsulate ordered transaction batches signed by their originating validator. Each sub-block records the transactions it contains, the validator's identity, a PoH hash, timestamp, and cryptographic signature【F:core/block.go†L10-L17】. The `NewSubBlock` constructor computes a deterministic hash of the transaction IDs, validator string, and timestamp before signing the result, binding the validator to the data it proposes【F:core/block.go†L19-L37】. Validators can later verify authenticity by recomputing and comparing signatures using `VerifySignature`【F:core/block.go†L39-L43】.

## Block Assembly, Fee Distribution, and Mining
`MineBlock` orchestrates the full block lifecycle. The node selects a validator using weighted stake, converts the mempool into a single sub-block, validates it, and links the new block to the previous hash before initiating PoW【F:core/node.go†L58-L83】. Transaction fees are aggregated, partitioned among development, charity, loan pools, validators and other stakeholders, then adjusted for block utilization and distributed proportionally through a contract that credits each recipient on-ledger【F:core/node.go†L85-L92】【F:core/fees.go†L115-L127】【F:core/fees.go†L240-L255】. The final block hash and nonce are discovered via SHA‑256 PoW, securing the block’s contents【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L207】.

## Block Composition and Header Hashing
Blocks gather validated sub-blocks, reference the previous block hash, and track a nonce, timestamp, and final hash value【F:core/block.go†L45-L52】. The `HeaderHash` function constructs the PoW target by hashing the previous hash, each sub-block's PoH hash, and the timestamp–nonce pair, yielding the value miners test during PoW computations【F:core/block.go†L54-L69】.

## Consensus Interaction
`ValidateSubBlock` enforces PoS and PoH checks by confirming that the sub-block is populated and signed by its declared validator【F:core/consensus.go†L180-L188】. Beyond mining, the `SynnergyConsensus` engine dynamically adjusts PoW, PoS, and PoH weightings in response to network demand and stake concentration, exposes threshold calculations, and can toggle method availability or mining rewards for enterprise policy control【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L89】【F:core/consensus.go†L121-L142】.

## Adaptive Difficulty and Validator Selection
Consensus provides a weighted‑random validator selection algorithm that prevents dominance by large stakeholders and returns no result if a single party exceeds half of total stake【F:core/consensus.go†L144-L177】. Mining difficulty can be tuned using `DifficultyAdjust`, which recomputes the target based on actual versus expected block times, allowing operators to maintain predictable block intervals【F:core/consensus.go†L121-L128】.

## Genesis Block Initialization
Network bootstrapping occurs through `InitGenesis`, which credits the creator wallet, constructs an empty sub-block, assembles it into the inaugural block, and mines it with minimal difficulty. The function records chain height, block hash, circulating supply, remaining supply, and consensus weights for auditability【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】.

## Smart Contract and CLI Interfaces
Developers and operators interact with block construction via smart contract opcodes and command-line tooling. Opcodes such as `ProposeSubBlock`, `ValidatePoH`, and `SealMainBlockPOW` expose sub-block proposal and block sealing capabilities within on-chain logic【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L120-L132】【F:core/opcode.go†L340-L345】. The `block` CLI provides utilities to craft sub-blocks, verify signatures, assemble blocks, and calculate header hashes, while `consensus` commands mine blocks, tune weightings, and adjust difficulty for operational testing【F:cli/block.go†L16-L90】【F:cli/consensus.go†L19-L138】.

## Ledger Integration and Persistence
The ledger maintains account balances, a UTXO view, and block history. `AddBlock` appends new blocks while persisting them to a write-ahead log; `replayWAL` restores prior state on startup, and helpers such as `Head` and `GetBlock` enable efficient inspection of chain state【F:core/ledger.go†L35-L113】. This persistence layer underpins enterprise recovery strategies and supports auditing of every committed block.

## Synchronization and Integrity
A dedicated `SyncManager` coordinates block downloads and maintains synchronization status, allowing nodes to track whether they are up-to-date with the network【F:core/blockchain_synchronization.go†L1-L54】. The repository also includes a placeholder `block_integrity_check.sh` script, signalling ongoing efforts toward automated verification of stored block data【F:scripts/block_integrity_check.sh†L1-L17】.

## Security Considerations
Sub-block signatures tie proposed data to validator identities, while slashing functions deter misbehavior and can rehabilitate validators after penalties have been served【F:core/node.go†L117-L138】. PoW sealing safeguards against retroactive manipulation, and persistent ledger plus synchronization tools provide a robust audit trail for Blackridge Group Ltd stakeholders.

## Conclusion
By modularizing validation into sub-blocks and finalizing state through PoW, Blackridge Group Ltd's Synnergy Network delivers a layered security model that balances performance, auditability, and decentralization across its blockchain infrastructure.

## Block rewards dispersions and halving

# Block Rewards Dispersions and Halving

*Prepared by Blackridge Group Ltd.*

## 1. Emission Overview
Synnergy Network's native currency, the Synthron coin (SYN), follows a capped issuance model. Key monetary constants are baked into the core protocol: a maximum supply of 500 million SYN, a 5 million SYN genesis allocation, an initial block reward of 1,252 SYN, and a halving interval of 200,000 blocks【F:core/coin.go†L6-L16】. With a three‑second target block time, each halving epoch spans roughly 6.9 days【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L19】.

## 2. Halving Mechanism
The halving schedule governs issuance using the relation `Reward(height) = 1252 / 2^n`, where `n` equals the number of completed 200,000‑block intervals. Once the shift has eliminated all significant bits, rewards fall to zero, enforcing the fixed supply. The `CirculatingSupply` and `RemainingSupply` helpers iterate through historical rewards to model supply at any block height and clamp output once the cap is reached【F:core/coin.go†L19-L49】.

### 2.1 Emission Forecast
The deterministic issuance curve rapidly approaches the cap, as summarised below.

| Epoch | Approx. day | Reward per block (SYN) | Coins minted in epoch (M SYN) | Cumulative supply (M SYN) |
|------:|------------:|-----------------------:|------------------------------:|--------------------------:|
| 1 | 6.9 | 1,252.00 | 250.40 | 255.40 |
| 2 | 13.9 | 626.00 | 125.20 | 380.60 |
| 3 | 20.8 | 313.00 | 62.60 | 443.20 |
| 4 | 27.8 | 156.50 | 31.30 | 474.50 |
| 5 | 34.7 | 78.25 | 15.65 | 490.15 |
| 6 | 41.7 | 39.13 | 7.83 | 497.98 |
| 7 | 48.6 | 19.56 | 2.03 | 500.00 |

Beyond the seventh epoch the block reward underflows to zero and the circulating supply remains at the 500 million SYN cap.

## 3. Reward Dispersion Model
Minted rewards per block are distributed exclusively to consensus participants. Synnergy’s consensus engine seeds weights of 30 % to Proof‑of‑Stake validators, 30 % to Proof‑of‑History schedulers and 40 % to Proof‑of‑Work miners【F:core/consensus.go†L41-L43】【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L19】. The dispersion is expressed as:

```
A_pos      = 0.30 * A_block  # PoS validators
A_poh      = 0.30 * A_block  # PoH schedulers
A_pow      = 0.40 * A_block  # PoW miners
```

`A_pos` and `A_poh` are further subdivided in proportion to validator stake and time‑slot attendance, while rewards are subject to a cooldown period to discourage short‑term hopping【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L405-L417】. Treasuries and ecosystem funds are financed solely from transaction fees, ensuring block rewards remain an incentive for security.

### 3.1 Dynamic Weight Rebalancing
Weights are not static. `AdjustWeights` recalibrates the distribution based on observed demand and stake concentration, clamping each mechanism between 7.5 % and 100 % before renormalising to unity【F:core/consensus.go†L61-L74】. This allows Blackridge operators to emphasise security primitives during periods of elevated load or threat.

### 3.2 Runtime Reward Controls
Operational teams may disable classes of validators or suspend PoW compensation without redeploying the network. `SetAvailability` toggles each consensus path, and `SetPoWRewards` halts payouts while leaving PoW participation for utility purposes【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】. The CLI exposes these levers via `synnergy consensus availability [pow] [pos] [poh]` and `synnergy consensus powrewards [enabled]`, the latter emitting audit logs when rewards are toggled【F:cli/consensus.go†L164-L176】.

## 4. Supply Tracking and Operational Tooling
Real‑time monitoring of emission progress is available through the CLI. `synnergy coin reward [height]` reveals the reward at a particular height, and `synnergy coin supply [height]` reports the circulating and remaining supply using the core helpers mentioned above【F:cli/coin.go†L31-L57】.

## 5. Economic and Security Implications
The aggressive halving cadence front‑loads distribution, quickly rewarding early participants while converging on the fixed supply to instill long‑term scarcity. Splitting rewards across Proof‑of‑Stake, Proof‑of‑History, and Proof‑of‑Work actors diversifies incentives and aligns security with resource contribution. As the reward diminishes, transaction fees and staking yields become the dominant revenue streams, promoting sustainable network operation.

## Blockchain Fees & Gas

# Blockchain Fees & Gas

## Overview
At **Blackridge Group Ltd**, the Synnergy Network employs a comprehensive fee and gas model to allocate resources, discourage spam, and reward participants. Every operation performed on the network consumes gas, and the corresponding fees ensure sustainable network economics and alignment with community stakeholders.

## Gas Accounting
Synnergy prices computation through a dedicated **GasTable** that maps each opcode to a deterministic cost. The table is parsed at runtime from `docs/reference/gas_table_list.md` and cached behind a `sync.Once` gate so all nodes share a consistent schedule. Unlisted operations fall back to a **DefaultGasCost** of `1`, allowing experimental opcodes to execute without prohibitive expense.

### Runtime Controls
- **Query and Introspection** – `GasCost` and `HasOpcode` expose lookups for wallets and explorers, while `GasCostByName` resolves exported function names to their current prices.
- **Dynamic Updates** – Operators can inject or override prices using `RegisterGasCost`; `ResetGasTable` clears the cache so tests or governance actions can reload revised schedules without restarting processes.
- **Audit Support** – `GasTableSnapshot` and its JSON variant provide immutable views of the live schedule for monitoring systems or compliance archives.

### CLI Integration
The `gas list` command prints the active cost of every registered opcode, ensuring developers and auditors can verify pricing directly from the command line.

## Fee Components
Every transaction fee is decomposed into three parts managed by the `FeeBreakdown` structure:
1. **Base Fee** – `CalculateBaseFee` derives a baseline from the median of the latest 1,000 block fees. `AdjustFeeRates` then scales this value to reflect current network load, while the optional AI routine `OptimiseBaseFee` can forecast an optimal starting point from recent statistics.
2. **Variable Fee** – `CalculateVariableFee` multiplies gas units by the current gas price per unit, translating opcode consumption into currency.
3. **Priority Fee** – `CalculatePriorityFee` captures the user’s tip, allowing transactions to signal urgency.

These components combine into a transparent total that wallets and explorers can display or audit in real time.

## Transaction-Specific Calculations
Synnergy supports tailored fee calculators for distinct transaction categories:
- **Transfers** – Fees scale with payload size.
- **Purchases** – Based on the number of contract calls executed.
- **Token Interactions** – Measured by computation units used when interacting with deployed tokens.
- **Contract Operations** – Reflect the complexity factor of new or modified contracts.
- **Wallet Verification** – Adjusted by the security level required.
- **Validated Transfers** – Eligible transfers verified by the network can execute fee-free.
A generic `EstimateFee` helper routes requests to the appropriate calculator, simplifying client implementations.

## Distribution of Fees
`DistributeFees` allocates revenue across nine pools, ensuring every collected unit advances a pillar of the ecosystem:

| Allocation Target            | Percentage |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Validators and miners        | 64%        |
| Internal development         | 5%         |
| Internal charity             | 5%         |
| External charity             | 5%         |
| Loan pool for ecosystem growth | 5%        |
| Passive-income program       | 5%         |
| Authority nodes              | 5%         |
| Node hosts                   | 5%         |
| Creator wallet               | 1%         |

Distribution contracts can credit these shares directly to ledger accounts via `FeeDistributionContract`. For bespoke arrangements—such as side agreements between validators—`ShareProportional` accepts weightings and reconciles rounding remainders so every unit of value is accounted for.

Deterministic addresses defined by `DefaultGenesisWallets` and seeded through `AllocateToGenesisWallets` receive these allocations at network launch, providing transparent treasuries for development, charity, and infrastructure upkeep.

## Fee Policies and Adjustments
- **Cap and Floor Enforcement** – The `FeePolicy` wrapper invokes `ApplyFeeCapFloor` and returns descriptive notes whenever limits are hit, giving clients a deterministic record of adjustments.
- **Dynamic Rate Adjustment** – `AdjustFeeRates` scales base and variable components with network load, maintaining equilibrium as congestion rises or falls.
- **Proportional Sharing** – `ShareProportional` divides arbitrary fee pools using integer weights, assigning any remainder to the highest-weighted participant.
- **Block Utilisation Rewards** – `AdjustForBlockUtilization` increases or decreases validator payouts by 10% based on actual block fill, incentivising efficient packing.

## Operational Considerations
- **Transaction Structure**: Each transaction includes an explicit fee field, ensuring deterministic ordering and verifiable cost accounting.
- **Reversal Requests**: Users seeking an authority-mediated reversal must reserve funds covering both the transfer amount and a return gas fee, protecting the network from abuse.
- **Evolving Gas Catalogue**: The gas table evolves alongside new features—from cross-chain bridges to biometric security commands—so cost visibility remains current as Synnergy expands.

## Enterprise Tooling and Optimisation
- **CLI Suite** – The `fees estimate` command models charges for transfers, purchases, token interactions, contract deployments and wallet verification while `fees share` computes proportional splits for custom arrangements. These tools mirror on-chain logic so operators can forecast costs before submission.
- **Optimization Nodes** – Dedicated nodes can reorder pending transactions using the `FeeOptimizer`, which sorts by fee density to maximise revenue per byte and maintain throughput under heavy load.
- **AI Insights** – The `OptimiseBaseFee` routine in the AI service digests recent network statistics and suggests base fee targets, enabling autonomous fee markets and predictive scaling.

## Conclusion
Blackridge Group Ltd’s fee and gas framework provides a balanced economic engine for the Synnergy Network. By coupling transparent gas accounting with flexible fee policies and equitable distribution, the platform delivers predictable costs, fosters community development, and upholds the long-term viability of the ecosystem.

## Blockchain Logic

# Blockchain Logic

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network delivers a multi‑layered blockchain where transaction validation, state management, and cross‑chain orchestration operate in concert. The platform combines proof‑of‑history (PoH), proof‑of‑stake (PoS), and proof‑of‑work (PoW) to finalise blocks while a modular virtual machine executes programmable logic. This document details the core components that underpin ledger integrity and network determinism.

## Block Structure and Lifecycle
Transactions first aggregate into **sub‑blocks** ordered by PoH and signed by a selected validator. Each sub‑block records its transaction list, validator identity, timestamp, PoH hash, and signature, ensuring deterministic ordering and PoS attestation【F:core/block.go†L10-L24】【F:core/block.go†L27-L37】. A full **block** then bundles validated sub‑blocks, references the previous block hash, and is sealed via a nonce that satisfies the PoW target derived from the header hash【F:core/block.go†L45-L67】. This three‑stage process—PoH sequencing, PoS validation, and PoW finalisation—anchors every block to an auditable chain of computation.

## Transaction Model
The transaction format captures sender, receiver, amount, fee, nonce, timestamp, signature, and type, with optional biometric hashes and embedded bytecode for contract execution【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L35】. Factory helpers deterministically derive transaction IDs before signing, ensuring reproducible hashes across nodes【F:core/transaction.go†L38-L53】. The hash routine incorporates all monetary fields and the biometric digest so any alteration invalidates the signature, while verification and biometric attachment enforce authentic user authorisation【F:core/transaction.go†L56-L72】【F:core/transaction.go†L74-L95】.

## Ledger State and UTXO Management
Balances, blocks, UTXO sets, and a mem‑pool reside within the ledger structure, protected by read–write locks for concurrent access【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L33】. Blocks appended through `AddBlock` persist to a write‑ahead log, allowing nodes to recover state after failure, and `ApplyTransaction` debits sender funds, credits recipients, and maintains UTXO entries atomically【F:core/ledger.go†L107-L170】. This ledger design preserves double‑spend resistance while providing deterministic replay of historical blocks.

## Node Responsibilities and Block Production
A node instance maintains its own ledger view, consensus engine, virtual machine, and stake map【F:core/node.go†L8-L33】. Incoming transactions pass through `ValidateTransaction` before entering the mem‑pool【F:core/node.go†L37-L56】. During block production the node selects an eligible validator, constructs a sub‑block, validates it via the consensus engine, mines the encompassing block, applies transactions to the ledger, and distributes fees proportionally to stakeholders【F:core/node.go†L58-L94】.

## Consensus Integration
`SynnergyConsensus` bootstraps with configurable weights (40% PoW, 30% PoS, 30% PoH) and exposes parameters for adaptive tuning as network demand and stake concentration fluctuate【F:core/consensus.go†L38-L52】. The `AdjustWeights` routine smooths updates, enforces minimum participation thresholds, and renormalises totals while honouring availability flags【F:core/consensus.go†L61-L89】. For PoW, `MineBlock` iterates nonces until the SHA‑256 header hash meets the difficulty requirement, embedding the result in the block header【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L206】.

## Genesis and Monetary Supply
`InitGenesis` mints the initial allocation, mines the first block, appends it to the ledger, and returns supply statistics alongside the starting consensus weights【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】. The function guards against re‑initialisation, ensuring the genesis block remains a unique anchor for the entire chain.

## Virtual Machine and Contract Execution
The lightweight **SimpleVM** interprets 24‑bit opcodes with a pluggable handler map and configurable concurrency limits, enabling nodes to execute embedded programs within transactions or registry contracts【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L11-L38】【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L49-L80】【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L96-L121】. Start/Stop controls and limiter channels provide resource governance across heavy, light, and super‑light modes.

## Validator Governance and Slashing
`ValidatorNode` combines base node behaviour with stake tracking and quorum enforcement, exposing methods to add, remove, or slash validators and to determine if quorum has been reached【F:core/validator_node.go†L5-L20】【F:core/validator_node.go†L23-L46】. Within the node core, staking enforces minimum deposits, while dedicated slashing handlers halve stake and flag misbehaving validators for offences such as double‑signing or downtime【F:core/node.go†L96-L132】.

## Cross‑Chain Coordination
The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges between external networks, authorises relayers, and tracks each bridge's source, target, and permitted relayer set in thread‑safe maps【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L90】. This foundation enables Blackridge deployments to exchange assets or messages across heterogeneous chains under controlled governance.

## Dynamic Consensus and Network Adaptation
The `ConsensusHopper` monitors transactions per second, network latency, and validator counts to switch between PoW, PoS, and PoH as conditions change【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L29】. Its `Evaluate` routine promotes PoS during high throughput, selects PoH when validator participation drops, and otherwise defaults to PoW, ensuring the chain maintains performance and security across varying loads【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L70】.

## High Availability and Energy Efficiency
`FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes the most recent backup when the primary node misses its timeout, sustaining service during outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L25】【F:high_availability.go†L42-L69】. To reduce environmental impact, `EnergyEfficiencyTracker` aggregates each validator's transactions per kilowatt hour and network averages, while `EnergyEfficientNode` issues sustainability certificates and throttles nodes that fall below efficiency thresholds【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L60】【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L74-L80】.

## Private Transactions and Zero‑Trust Data Exchange
AES‑GCM routines encrypt payloads and bundle the nonce for decryption, enabling the `PrivateTxManager` to queue confidential transactions without exposing plaintext【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L27】【F:private_transactions.go†L48-L74】. For off‑chain coordination, the `ZeroTrustEngine` opens ed25519‑backed channels where encrypted messages are signed and stored, allowing parties to verify and decrypt records on demand【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L47】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L50-L67】.

## Regulatory Compliance and Audit Nodes
`RegulatoryManager` catalogues jurisdictional rules and flags transactions that exceed configured limits【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L47】【F:regulatory_management.go†L64-L75】. Regulator‑operated nodes leverage this manager to approve or reject transfers and maintain immutable logs of flagged entities, providing a built‑in audit trail for oversight bodies【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】【F:regulatory_node.go†L35-L49】.

## Identity and Access Management
The AccessController enforces role‑based permissions while the IdentityService records verified user metadata and audit logs, ensuring only authorised, registered parties can initiate transactions or interact with on‑chain services【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】.

## Network Monitoring, Firewall, and Anomaly Detection
SystemHealthLogger captures runtime metrics for external inspection, Watchtower nodes stream these snapshots and log forks, the Firewall blocks malicious addresses, tokens, or IPs, and a streaming AnomalyDetector flags statistical outliers before they escalate into attacks【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】【F:firewall.go†L5-L66】【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Indexing and Geospatial Analytics
Indexing nodes maintain in‑memory key/value stores for low‑latency queries while Geospatial nodes record location traces, enabling enterprise deployments to couple ledger events with spatial context and accelerate lookups across regulatory domains【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L25】【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L39】.

## Security and Auditability
Biometric hashes within transactions tie on‑chain activity to verified identities, ledger WAL persistence ensures replayable history, and validator slashing deters malicious behaviour. Combined with consensus weight adjustments, zero‑trust channels, regulatory logging, and cross‑chain access controls, Blackridge’s blockchain logic offers a robust, auditable ledger designed for regulated environments.

## Central banks

# Central Banks

*Prepared by **Blackridge Group Ltd.** as part of the Synnergy Network whitepaper.*

## Strategic Role within the Synnergy Network
Central banks act as sovereign monetary authorities on the Synnergy Network, enabling the issuance and management of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) while preserving the integrity of the capped native SYN coin supply. Dedicated node roles coordinate with government and regulatory nodes and log policy decisions to the public ledger, providing transparent reporting to citizens and partners.

## Node Architecture and Lifecycle
`CentralBankingNode` extends the base `Node` and attaches a managed SYN10 token for fiat‑pegged issuance. The constructor `NewCentralBankingNode` wires the node ID, network address, underlying ledger and initial policy, ensuring the SYN coin supply remains fixed【F:core/central_banking_node.go†L1-L24】. Bank node categories are enumerated in `BankNodeTypes`, delineating central, institutional and custodial roles for permissioned deployments【F:core/bank_nodes_index.go†L3-L15】. The ledger backing each node persists block history via an optional write‑ahead log so state can be replayed after restart, supporting enterprise‑grade durability【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L49】.

## Monetary Policy Management
Central bank nodes publish descriptive policy statements that can be revised in real time. The `UpdatePolicy` method records new guidance, while `MintCBDC` mints CBDC units but rejects zero‑value transfers and never touches the fixed SYN supply【F:core/central_banking_node.go†L27-L37】. Unit tests verify that minting updates the token balance without affecting the ledger, reinforcing separation between CBDCs and native coins【F:core/central_banking_node_test.go†L9-L24】.

## CBDC Token Standard
CBDC issuance leverages the SYN10 token, which embeds thread‑safe issuer metadata and an adjustable fiat exchange rate【F:internal/tokens/syn10.go†L1-L50】. Exchange rates may be revised at runtime via `SetExchangeRate`, allowing monetary authorities to mirror macroeconomic conditions without redeploying contracts【F:internal/tokens/syn10.go†L24-L28】. SYN10 inherits from the concurrency‑safe `BaseToken`, providing allowance checks, minting, burning and transfer semantics suitable for regulated assets【F:internal/tokens/base.go†L27-L47】.

## Treasury Instruments and Liquidity Operations
Beyond retail CBDCs, the platform supports tokenised government securities for open‑market activity. The SYN12 specification tokenises treasury bills with metadata for issuance date, maturity, discount rate and face value【F:internal/tokens/syn12.go†L1-L23】. Central banks can circulate these instruments to manage liquidity while retaining audited supply controls through the underlying `BaseToken` framework.

## Identity and Compliance Frameworks
Sovereign nodes interface with an embedded `IdentityService` to register and verify participants before CBDC distribution. The service stores personal metadata, records verification methods and exposes an immutable audit log for regulators【F:identity_verification.go†L1-L56】. Regulatory oversight is enforced by `RegulatoryManager` and `RegulatoryNode` components, which catalogue jurisdiction‑specific rules and flag non‑compliant transactions for review【F:regulatory_management.go†L1-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L1-L37】.

Central banks further employ the `ComplianceService` to manage KYC commitments, log fraud signals and maintain address‑level risk scores. Each validation or alert appends an audit entry, and full trails can be exported for supervisory review via `AuditTrail`【F:compliance.go†L42-L110】.

## Audit Logging and Reporting
`AuditManager` coordinates tamper‑evident event logs and is typically deployed alongside a bootstrap node as an `AuditNode` for network‑wide collection. Events are stored with timestamps and optional metadata so regulators can reconstruct historical actions or produce statutory reports【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】【F:core/audit_node.go†L12-L41】.

## Operational Interfaces
The `synnergy centralbank` CLI exposes `info`, `policy` and `mint` subcommands with an optional `--json` flag for structured output【F:cli/centralbank.go†L18-L48】. A CLI regression test confirms that the `info` command emits the expected node identifiers for integration scripts【F:cli/centralbank_test.go†L8-L19】. Underlying operations are mapped to deterministic virtual‑machine opcodes, enabling audit‑ready execution paths for node creation, policy updates and minting【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L885-L887】.

## Governance and Regulatory Boundaries
Interfaces in `internal/nodes/bank_nodes` define required behaviours for central banking nodes and segregate capabilities from institutional and custodial peers【F:internal/nodes/bank_nodes/index.go†L5-L22】. Government authority nodes intentionally lack functions to mint SYN or modify monetary policy, preserving central bank independence within the governance model【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

## Security, Monitoring, and High Availability
Central bank operations can be routed through the Zero‑Trust Engine, which establishes encrypted channels with per‑message signatures for tamper‑evident communication【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L67】. Runtime metrics and peer counts are captured by `SystemHealthLogger` for export to oversight dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】. `FailoverManager` tracks heartbeats and promotes backup nodes when primaries go offline, ensuring continuity of monetary services【F:high_availability.go†L8-L45】.

## Interoperability and Cross‑Border Settlement
The `CrossChainTxManager` executes lock‑and‑mint and burn‑and‑release operations. `LockMint` escrows native assets and credits wrapped tokens to the destination chain, while `BurnRelease` destroys wrapped tokens and releases the locked collateral. Each transfer is recorded with identifiers and bridge metadata so settlement steps remain auditable across networks【F:core/cross_chain_transactions.go†L43-L75】.

## Typical Use Cases
- **Domestic CBDC issuance:** deploy SYN10 tokens with national exchange rates and distribute through commercial banks.
- **Real-time policy broadcasting:** append monetary updates to the public ledger for citizen visibility.
- **Cross-chain settlement:** bridge assets to and from external networks using lock‑mint and burn‑release workflows.
- **Automated compliance reporting:** stream KYC validations and fraud alerts into audited logs for supervisory bodies.

## Validation and Testing
Structured unit tests exercise the minting path, confirming that ledger balances remain immutable when CBDC units are created and that zero‑amount requests are rejected【F:core/central_banking_node_test.go†L9-L24】. Additional CLI tests verify subcommand output and error handling for automated deployments【F:cli/centralbank_test.go†L8-L19】.

## Conclusion
By combining precise monetary controls with open‑source transparency, the Synnergy Network—engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**—provides central banks a secure, extensible platform for CBDC innovation. The architecture ensures that sovereign authorities can evolve their digital currencies while maintaining the durability, auditability and interoperability required for national financial systems.

## Charity

# Charity

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. embeds philanthropy into the core of the Synnergy Network. The charity subsystem channels on-chain revenue and community contributions toward transparent, programmable aid. Every donation, vote, and disbursement is auditable on the ledger, ensuring that social impact accompanies technological innovation.

## Funding Allocation
A fixed percentage of every transaction fee is earmarked for charitable causes. The `DistributeFees` policy routes five percent of fees to Blackridge's internal initiatives and another five percent to an external community pool【F:core/fees.go†L101-L127】. This predictable allocation guarantees continual funding regardless of market activity.

## Genesis Configuration and Treasury Accounts
The initial ledger defines dedicated addresses for the internal and external pools, ensuring separation of duties and traceability from day one【F:configs/genesis.json†L4-L21】. Both accounts start with a zero balance, relying entirely on the automated fee stream and community donations for funding. Addresses are deterministically derived from hashed labels and the fee distribution routine maps allocations to these wallets, enabling independent auditing of genesis funds【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L59】.

## Charity Pool Architecture
Two dedicated ledger accounts segregate internal and external funds: `internal_charity` and `charity_pool`【F:core/charity.go†L66-L69】. The `CharityPool` smart component coordinates registrations, deposits, voting, and future payouts while guarding state with a mutex for concurrent safety【F:core/charity.go†L57-L60】:

- **Deposits:** Transfers into `charity_pool` are validated to ensure sufficient balance and a non-zero amount before crediting the pool【F:core/charity.go†L76-L87】.
- **Registrations:** Organizations submit an address, name, and mission category, which are persisted under `charity:reg:*` keys for auditability【F:core/charity.go†L90-L100】.
- **Voting:** Eligible SYN900 identity holders can cast a vote for a registered charity each funding cycle; votes are stored using the `charity:vote:*` prefix【F:core/charity.go†L103-L113】.
- **Record Retrieval:** Registration data can be queried per cycle for transparency and compliance tracking【F:core/charity.go†L125-L136】.
- **Maintenance:** Manual `tick` operations reserve space for future automated payouts and cycle management【F:cli/charity.go†L97-L113】.
- **Winners:** The CLI exposes a `winners` command, preparing the infrastructure for distributing pooled funds to top‑voted charities【F:cli/charity.go†L145-L170】.

The pool currently tracks votes and registrations while leaving automatic disbursement logic to future iterations. Categories span hunger relief, child welfare, wildlife and marine support, disaster response, and war relief, enabling targeted reporting and governance【F:core/charity.go†L15-L22】. All ledger interactions flow through a narrow `StateRW` interface, allowing alternative backends and prefix‑based queries for auditors without exposing unrelated state【F:core/state_rw.go†L11-L19】.

## Community Workflow
1. **Register** – A charity submits its wallet, name, and category to join the pool.
2. **Vote** – SYN900 token holders endorse preferred charities during each cycle; non‑holders are rejected at the consensus layer【F:core/charity.go†L103-L110】【F:core/charity_test.go†L22-L29】.
3. **Donate** – Anyone may contribute additional tokens to strengthen the external pool or Blackridge’s internal fund.
4. **Disburse** – At cycle end, top‑voted charities become eligible for payouts from accumulated fees and donations.

## Command‑Line Interface
The network CLI exposes comprehensive controls for charity operations:

- `synnergy charity_pool register [addr] [category] [name]` — register a charity.
- `synnergy charity_pool vote [voterAddr] [charityAddr]` — cast a vote.
- `synnergy charity_pool tick [timestamp]` — advance the pool’s cron tasks.
- `synnergy charity_pool winners [cycle]` — list winning charities for a cycle.
- `synnergy charity_mgmt donate [from] [amt]` — deposit funds into the pool.
- `synnergy charity_mgmt withdraw [to] [amt]` — withdraw internal charity funds.
- `synnergy charity_mgmt balances` — display pooled and internal balances.

Each command optionally emits JSON for integration with dashboards and automation tools【F:cli/charity.go†L68-L222】. Unit tests confirm the JSON flag works for both registration lookups and balance reports, enabling reliable machine consumption【F:cli/charity_test.go†L8-L32】.

## Ledger Integration and Auditing
The `AllocateToGenesisWallets` routine applies the fee policy to the deterministically derived addresses, producing a verifiable map of allocations for compliance review【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L44-L59】. The pool’s reliance on the `StateRW` abstraction allows operators to plug in enterprise ledger implementations while retaining prefix-scoped inspection and balance checks.

## Security and Quality Assurance
Mutex protections around pool state and read‑write locks within the SYN4200 token registry safeguard concurrent operations under heavy load【F:core/charity.go†L57-L60】【F:core/syn4200_token.go†L16-L30】. Dedicated tests validate deposits, registrations and voter eligibility, ensuring that invalid participants cannot influence outcomes【F:core/charity_test.go†L34-L52】.

## SYN4200 Charity Tracking Token
The SYN4200 token family records donations to specific campaigns and exposes progress metrics. Campaigns capture a symbol, purpose, goal, and individual contributions, allowing sponsors to audit fundraising in real time【F:core/syn4200_token.go†L7-L42】. The registry guards access with a read‑write mutex so high‑volume donation flows remain thread‑safe【F:core/syn4200_token.go†L16-L30】. CLI helpers let donors contribute and query progress directly from scripts or enterprise backends【F:cli/syn4200_token.go†L13-L49】.

## Opcode and Virtual Machine Hooks
At the opcode layer the network reserves dedicated slots for charity functions, from pool management to token progress queries【F:core/opcode.go†L292-L301】【F:core/opcode.go†L988-L993】. These opcodes stabilise gas metering and give the virtual machine consistent entry points for monitoring or pausing charitable activity during audits.

## Enterprise Integration and Reporting
Operational commands support machine‑readable output, scripted donations and automated reconciliation. The management CLI exposes deposit, withdrawal and balance queries for treasury teams【F:cli/charity.go†L178-L220】, while the SYN4200 token CLI records campaign donations and reports progress for dashboards【F:cli/syn4200_token.go†L13-L49】.

## Transparency and Future Directions
All charity interactions are immutably stored, aligning Blackridge Group Ltd.'s charitable commitments with verifiable blockchain records. Planned enhancements include automated payout workflows, expanded campaign analytics, and on-chain governance to fine‑tune funding strategies.

## Community needs

# Community Needs

## Mission
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to address tangible community priorities. The platform channels on-chain resources toward social welfare, economic empowerment and ecosystem innovation, ensuring that every network participant can contribute to and benefit from shared prosperity.

## Strategic Funding Pools

### LoanPool
The LoanPool aggregates a portion of transaction fees and allocates them to targeted programmes ranging from poverty alleviation to small business support. Managed proposals undergo submission, open voting and timed evaluation before approved disbursements reduce the treasury balance, enabling transparent credit distribution for community initiatives【F:core/loanpool.go†L9-L75】【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/loanpool_guide.md†L3-L79】.

Key funding categories include:
- **Poverty Fund** – non‑repayable grants for immediate relief.
- **Unsecured and Secured Loans** – income‑based lending with optional collateral.
- **Business and Personal Grants** – proposal‑driven awards vetted by node and authority votes.
- **Ecosystem Innovation Fund** – resources for research, infrastructure and application development.
- **Healthcare, Education and Environmental Funds** – dedicated pools supporting critical public services and sustainability.
- **Small Business Support** – financing for SMEs to drive local economic growth.

#### Proposal Lifecycle
Proposals are time‑boxed to a 24‑hour voting window and created only when the pool is unpaused【F:core/loanpool.go†L26-L35】. Votes can be cast until the deadline expires, after which the `Tick` routine automatically approves any proposal with recorded votes【F:core/loanpool.go†L37-L56】. Approved items trigger treasury checks during disbursement to prevent overspending【F:core/loanpool.go†L60-L75】.

#### Application Pipeline
For smaller consumer loans, the `LoanPoolApply` service accepts streamlined applications, registers voter endorsements, finalises approvals with a single recorded vote and performs disbursements against the same treasury ledger【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L5-L82】. This pipeline enables rapid financing while still enforcing community oversight.

#### Administrative Controls
A dedicated manager can pause or resume proposal intake and provides real‑time statistics on treasury levels, proposal counts and disbursement activity for operational dashboards【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L3-L44】. Creators retain unilateral control to cancel or extend their own proposals before funds are released, safeguarding against rushed or malicious submissions【F:core/loanpool.go†L93-L116】.

#### Audit Views and CLI Integration
Serialisable proposal and application views expose creator details, vote totals and disbursement status for external dashboards and audits【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L97】. Comprehensive CLI tooling allows administrators to submit, vote, process, cancel and extend proposals or list the full ledger of requests directly from the command line, supporting automated governance workflows【F:cli/loanpool.go†L15-L120】.

### Charity Pool
The Charity Pool coordinates donations and voting for registered organisations across categories such as hunger relief, child welfare, wildlife preservation, marine support, disaster response and war assistance. Voter eligibility hinges on SYN900 identity tokens, preserving one‑person‑one‑vote integrity while ledger entries record deposits, registrations and ballots for full auditability【F:core/charity.go†L12-L113】.

#### Categories and Registration
Six built‑in categories—ranging from hunger relief to war support—anchor funding priorities at the protocol level【F:core/charity.go†L12-L22】. Registrations capture each charity’s address, name and category; all writes are mutex‑protected to prevent race conditions during concurrent submissions【F:core/charity.go†L43-L100】.

#### Deposits and Fund Handling
Deposits validate ledger configuration, ensure balances cover the contribution and transfer funds into the pooled account, guaranteeing that donations are backed by actual holdings【F:core/charity.go†L76-L88】.

#### Voting and Cycle Operations
Voting invokes an electorate interface that checks SYN900 identity tokens, enforcing one‑person‑one‑vote policies and persisting ballots for later tabulation【F:core/charity.go†L103-L113】. Periodic `Tick` operations handle future payout logic, while both winning selections and historical registrations are queryable for compliance reviews【F:core/charity.go†L116-L136】.

#### CLI Management
A full command‑line suite supports pool registration, voting, manual ticking, donation management and balance audits, enabling enterprise automation of charity workflows【F:cli/charity.go†L72-L224】.

### Fee Distribution and Treasury Routing
Network fees are automatically split between development, charitable reserves, the LoanPool, validator rewards and other stakeholders. Five percent of every fee supports internal development, with a further five percent each directed to internal and external charities; ten percent is reserved for the LoanPool, five percent for passive income programs, fifty‑nine percent for validators and miners, and the remainder for authority nodes, node hosts and the creator wallet【F:core/fees.go†L101-L128】. Deterministic genesis wallet addresses are generated by hashing human‑readable labels, allowing any observer to recompute the addresses that receive these distributions from the first block onward【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L22-L58】.

Fee policies can impose network‑wide caps and floors, adjusting charges to stay within governance‑approved limits and returning explanatory notes when thresholds are triggered【F:core/fees.go†L130-L158】.

## Governance and Participation
Community members exercise influence through proposal voting, charity selections and ongoing polls. Only verified identity‑token holders can cast ballots in the Charity Pool, ensuring accountable participation and preventing duplicate voting【F:core/charity.go†L103-L113】. Similar mechanisms underpin LoanPool governance, where proposal approval depends on recorded votes and deadlines【F:core/loanpool.go†L37-L56】. Creators retain control over their submissions with pause, cancel and extension capabilities, providing safeguards against misuse or rushed decision‑making【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L21-L29】【F:core/loanpool.go†L93-L116】.

## Transparency and Accountability
All fund movements and governance actions are immutably logged on the ledger. Proposal and application views provide live snapshots of funding decisions, while `GetRegistration` exposes charity metadata for any cycle and `ProposalInfo` returns serialised loan proposals for external verification【F:core/charity.go†L125-L136】【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L35-L52】. Genesis wallet labelling enables independent auditing from deterministic first‑block addresses【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L22-L58】, and the extensive CLI surface ensures that every governance action can be reproduced or inspected from scripted environments【F:cli/loanpool.go†L15-L120】【F:cli/charity.go†L72-L224】.

## Social Impact and Sustainability
By dedicating treasury streams to welfare, education, healthcare and environmental stewardship, the Synnergy Network embeds social responsibility at protocol level. Targeted funding categories empower communities to respond to immediate needs while also investing in long‑term resilience and innovation.

## Conclusion
The Community Needs framework demonstrates how Blackridge Group Ltd. integrates social impact with decentralized finance. Through structured funding pools, transparent governance and deterministic accounting, the Synnergy Network ensures that community welfare remains a core outcome of network activity.

## Connecting to other blockchains

# Connecting to Other Blockchains

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd positions Synnergy as a network that can participate in the wider blockchain ecosystem.  Interoperability is achieved through modular components that register bridges, manage active connections, standardize protocol definitions and coordinate asset movements across chains.  These mechanisms allow Synnergy deployments to exchange value and state with external networks without sacrificing determinism or auditability.

## Bridge Configuration and Relayer Governance
At the heart of cross‑network connectivity is the bridge registry.  Each bridge entry records the source and target chains along with a whitelist of relayer addresses authorized to move messages or assets【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L16】【F:cross_chain.go†L18-L48】.  Relayer permissions are managed through explicit authorization and revocation calls so operators can enforce governance policies and rotate credentials as required【F:cross_chain.go†L70-L82】.

Beyond per‑bridge whitelists, the manager also maintains a global relayer allow‑list so administrators can revoke compromised operators across every bridge from a single registry【F:cross_chain.go†L18-L23】【F:cross_chain.go†L70-L82】.

The `CrossChainManager` employs a read/write mutex to guarantee thread‑safe updates in high‑throughput environments, while deterministic bridge identifiers are derived from SHA‑256 hashing to avoid collisions【F:cross_chain.go†L18-L48】.  Bridges can be enumerated and retrieved individually, allowing dashboards to reconcile configuration state in real time【F:cross_chain.go†L51-L67】.  Stage‑18 tests further verify that relayer accounts can be authorized and revoked on demand, protecting the bridge from rogue operators【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L5-L28】.

## Establishing and Managing Connections
Bridges rely on durable connections between participating chains.  The connection manager issues a unique SHA‑256 based identifier for every link and tracks its lifecycle from open to close, including timestamps for auditing【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L42】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L45-L58】.  Administrators can query individual connections or enumerate all active links to monitor network topology【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L61-L77】.

Each `ChainConnection` persists open and close times alongside a closure flag, enabling forensic reconstruction of link history【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L18】.  Safeguards reject double‑close attempts, ensuring operators cannot inadvertently sever a connection twice【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L45-L58】【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L63-L74】.  These controls allow Blackridge Group Ltd deployments to maintain deterministic state across multiple chains without orphaned sessions.

## Protocol and Contract Interoperability
To maintain compatibility with diverse ecosystems, Synnergy maintains registries for protocol standards and contract mappings:

- **Protocol Registry** – A chain‑agnostic catalog of supported interoperability standards, allowing new protocols to be registered dynamically and queried by identifier【F:cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go†L10-L33】【F:cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go†L36-L53】.  The registry’s mutex guarantees consistent reads during concurrent updates, while tests confirm protocols can be added and retrieved with integrity【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L31-L44】.
- **Cross‑Chain Contract Registry** – Maps local contract addresses to their counterparts on remote chains, enabling deterministic resolution of cross‑chain invocations and upgrades【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L5-L31】【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L34-L58】.  Mappings may be removed when contracts are upgraded or decommissioned, preventing stale references and ensuring accurate routing【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L53-L57】【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L77-L91】.

## Asset Transfer Workflow
Asset mobility is orchestrated through two complementary managers:

- **Bridge Transfer Manager** – Records deposits and proofs for discrete token movements.  Each transfer structure captures sender, receiver, asset amount, token identifier and lifecycle timestamps for full traceability【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L21】.  Deposits lock assets and assign a cryptographic ID, while claims validate proofs, record claim time and reject double‑spend attempts【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L35-L66】【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L46-L61】.
- **Transaction Manager** – Captures higher‑level transfer semantics such as *lock‑and‑mint* or *burn‑and‑release*, storing bridge IDs, asset identifiers and recipient addresses for audit-ready histories【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】.  Transaction records can be listed and queried individually, enabling downstream systems to reconcile cross‑chain flows【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L67-L84】【F:cross_chain_stage18_test.go†L93-L106】.

These layers ensure that every cross‑chain operation—from the underlying escrow to the wrapped token lifecycle—is accounted for within Synnergy's ledger.

In the core ledger‑aware implementation, deposits debit the sender's balance and move funds into a bridge escrow account before creating a transfer record, while successful claims credit the recipient and mark the transfer as complete【F:core/cross_chain_bridge.go†L107-L125】【F:core/cross_chain_bridge.go†L127-L144】.  The transaction manager follows the same pattern: *lock‑and‑mint* escrows native assets and credits wrapped tokens, whereas *burn‑and‑release* burns the representation and releases the original asset back to the recipient【F:core/cross_chain_transactions.go†L43-L58】【F:core/cross_chain_transactions.go†L61-L76】.

## Performance and Scalability
To meet enterprise throughput requirements, benchmark suites stress‑test the transaction manager across lock‑and‑mint, burn‑and‑release and query operations【F:cross_chain_transactions_benchmark_test.go†L5-L40】.  These measurements guide capacity planning and ensure Synnergy bridges can sustain high volumes without degrading consistency.

## Security and Auditability
Every connection and transfer is accompanied by immutable metadata.  Hash‑derived identifiers prevent collisions, relayer whitelists restrict message flow to vetted parties and proof‑based claims protect asset release.  Double‑spend and double‑close checks further harden the environment against operational mistakes or malicious retries【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L53-L66】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L45-L58】.  Together, these controls provide the transparent audit trail and governance model expected from a Blackridge Group Ltd platform.

## Developer Interfaces
Synnergy ships with a suite of Cobra‑based CLI modules to automate these operations:

- `cross_chain` registers bridges, lists configurations and adjusts relayer allow‑lists while reporting gas consumption for each action【F:cli/cross_chain.go†L20-L33】【F:cli/cross_chain.go†L34-L75】.
- `cross_chain_bridge` locks tokens, processes proof‑based claims and retrieves transfer history, with every command offering JSON output and deterministic gas metrics【F:cli/cross_chain_bridge.go†L26-L53】【F:cli/cross_chain_bridge.go†L55-L106】.
- `cross_chain_connection` opens and closes chain links using numeric identifiers so operators can monitor topology programmatically【F:cli/cross_chain_connection.go†L26-L44】【F:cli/cross_chain_connection.go†L44-L66】.
- `cross_tx` executes *lock‑and‑mint* and *burn‑and‑release* flows end‑to‑end, binding each step to ledger operations and emitting structured transaction records【F:cli/cross_chain_transactions.go†L25-L50】【F:cli/cross_chain_transactions.go†L58-L83】.

All commands expose a `--json` flag for machine‑readable output and compute gas via the shared cost table, enabling integration with dashboards and automation pipelines.

## Conclusion
By combining bridge management, protocol registries, contract mappings and transaction tracking, Synnergy delivers a comprehensive framework for connecting to other blockchains.  Blackridge Group Ltd continues to refine these components so enterprises can confidently extend their operations across heterogeneous networks while retaining the security and consistency that define the Synnergy platform.

## Consensus

# Consensus

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. integrates a multi-algorithm consensus engine within the Synnergy Network to balance security, scalability, and decentralization. The platform combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Proof-of-History (PoH) to dynamically adapt to real‑time network conditions while retaining deterministic settlement and auditability.

## Hybrid Consensus Engine
SynnergyConsensus assigns proportional weights to PoW, PoS, and PoH. These weights are normalized and never drop below a minimum floor unless a mechanism is unavailable, allowing the chain to emphasize the most effective algorithm under varying demand and stake distributions【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L88】.

### Adaptive Weighting
An AdaptiveManager continuously tunes the weights using live metrics such as transaction demand and stake concentration. Adjustments remain thread-safe and expose the updated weighting matrix for external monitoring tools【F:core/consensus_adaptive_management.go†L5-L26】. The core engine decomposes the transition threshold into load, security and stake components before combining them, allowing operators to reason about which factor triggered a shift in weights【F:core/consensus.go†L91-L119】.

### Threshold and Control Flags
Fine-grained threshold functions compute the individual contributions of network load, adversarial pressure, and stake concentration before forming a composite value that determines whether rebalancing is required【F:core/consensus.go†L91-L119】. Administrators can disable PoW, PoS, or PoH or suspend PoW rewards in real time; the engine renormalizes the remaining weights automatically through availability and reward toggles【F:core/consensus.go†L71-L88】【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】.

### Difficulty Management
A dedicated DifficultyManager maintains PoW difficulty using a sliding window of recent block times. Each new sample recalculates the target difficulty to keep block production stable despite changes in hash power【F:core/consensus_difficulty.go†L5-L42】.

### Mining and Sub-Block Validation
Sub-blocks encapsulate a validator’s ordered transactions, a Proof‑of‑History hash, and a signature, creating deterministic segments before block assembly【F:core/block.go†L10-L41】. During mining, a node selects a validator based on stake, packages its mempool into a sub-block, validates the signature, and aggregates the result into a candidate block【F:core/node.go†L58-L76】. SynnergyConsensus then verifies the sub-block and performs a SHA‑256 Proof‑of‑Work search to finalize the block, embedding the sub-block’s hash in the header to prove work and prevent tampering【F:core/consensus.go†L180-L200】.

## Genesis Bootstrapping
Initialization begins with a Genesis block mined by the active consensus engine. `InitGenesis` credits the creator wallet, mines the first block and records the initial consensus weights, returning a summary of circulating supply and block hash for audit purposes【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L40】.

## Dynamic Mode Switching
Synnergy supports dynamic mode evaluation through a ConsensusSwitcher that selects the dominant algorithm based on current weights【F:core/consensus_specific.go†L15-L45】. For fast reconfiguration, a ConsensusHopper evaluates runtime metrics—transactions per second, latency, and validator count—to jump between PoW, PoS, and PoH without manual intervention【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L70】.

### Consensus-Specific Nodes
Operators can deploy nodes locked to a single algorithm. A ConsensusSpecificNode configures its internal engine so that only the designated mode is available and fully weighted, enabling specialized infrastructure such as dedicated PoW miners or PoS validators【F:core/consensus_specific_node.go†L3-L30】.

## Validator Lifecycle and Governance
ValidatorManager tracks stake levels, eligibility, and slashing status. It enforces minimum staking thresholds, supports stake reductions for misbehaviour, and exposes an eligible set for proportional validator selection【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L11-L78】. The core engine then performs weighted random selection to nominate the next validator, ensuring no single actor can dominate consensus【F:core/consensus.go†L144-L177】. Validator operations—add, remove, slash and eligibility queries—are available through CLI commands for real‑time governance【F:cli/validator_management.go†L21-L89】.

## Cross-Consensus Networks
To interoperate with external systems, the ConsensusNetworkManager records connections between heterogeneous consensus environments. Networks can be registered, listed, or removed, allowing controlled scaling across differing algorithms and domains【F:core/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L8-L68】. Operators manage these links via CLI to register new networks, inspect existing ones or remove obsolete connections【F:cli/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L13-L109】.

## Operational Tooling
The ConsensusService runs the mining loop asynchronously, exposing start, stop, and info endpoints for integration with orchestration layers【F:core/consensus_start.go†L11-L61】. The `consensus` command suite supports block mining, weight inspection, on-demand adjustments, threshold and transition calculations, difficulty tuning, validator availability toggling, and PoW reward controls from a single interface【F:cli/consensus.go†L14-L180】. Dedicated utilities provide adaptive weight management, difficulty sampling, explicit mode evaluation, and construction of single-mode nodes for specialised deployments【F:cli/consensus_adaptive_management.go†L11-L70】【F:cli/consensus_difficulty.go†L11-L66】【F:cli/consensus_mode.go†L11-L63】【F:cli/consensus_specific_node.go†L13-L76】【F:cli/consensus_service.go†L12-L52】.

## Transaction Finality and Throughput
### Sub-Block Finality
Each sub-block's hash and validator signature create an immutable commitment to its transactions. Once a node accepts a sub-block, the transactions are applied to the ledger and the segment is queued for PoW finalization, allowing users to treat the operations as practically final while the block is being mined【F:core/block.go†L19-L41】【F:core/node.go†L67-L82】.

### Dynamic Capacity
The ConsensusHopper monitors network throughput, latency, and validator count to select the most efficient algorithm at runtime. High TPS with low latency favours PoS, few validators trigger PoH scheduling, and PoW secures the chain otherwise, letting the network scale capacity without bottlenecking transaction flow【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L22】【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L68】.

## Configuration and Telemetry
Default parameters are provisioned through network configuration files, defining baseline block times, initial weights, and availability flags so new deployments start from a predictable consensus posture【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L28】. The runtime service instruments its mining loop with the internal telemetry tracer, allowing operators to observe execution spans and block height reporting for proactive monitoring【F:core/consensus_start.go†L23-L44】.

## Security and Resilience
Availability flags let operators disable algorithms or pause PoW rewards to mitigate attacks or conserve resources, after which weights are renormalized automatically【F:core/consensus.go†L71-L88】【F:core/consensus.go†L130-L142】. Sub-block validation ensures only signed and populated segments are accepted into a block, providing a lightweight integrity check across PoS and PoH rounds【F:core/consensus.go†L180-L188】. Validator slashing reduces stake and marks offenders, reinforcing economic incentives for honest behaviour【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L54-L65】.
The sequential combination of signed sub-blocks and PoW finalization means an attacker must both forge a validator signature and outpace network hash power to rewrite history, significantly raising the cost of compromise【F:core/block.go†L19-L41】【F:core/consensus.go†L190-L200】.

## Conclusion
By fusing three consensus algorithms with adaptive weighting, validator governance, and extensive tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a resilient and configurable foundation for the Synnergy Network. The architecture accommodates evolving network dynamics while preserving auditable security guarantees.

## Contracts

# Contracts

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to provide a deterministic and enterprise‑grade smart contract platform. This document details the contract framework, from compilation and deployment to management, security, and cross‑chain interoperability.

## Contract Lifecycle
### Compilation
- Contracts are authored in a supported high‑level language and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM).
- `CompileWASM` validates the bytecode and produces a SHA‑256 hash used for deterministic addressing.

### Deployment
- `Deploy` registers a contract by its bytecode hash, stores optional Ricardian manifest data, and enforces per‑contract gas limits.
- The resulting address is collision‑resistant and derived solely from bytecode, ensuring predictable deployments across environments.

### Invocation
- `Invoke` executes a method on the contract through the configured virtual machine, automatically enforcing the gas ceiling and checking the paused state.
- Output data and consumed gas are returned for auditability.

### Deterministic Hex Encoding
- `CompileWASM` emits a 32‑byte SHA‑256 digest and exposes it as a 64‑character hex string that serves as the canonical contract identifier.
- The address is deterministic: redeploying identical bytecode always yields the same 64‑character value, allowing offline build verification and protecting against address squatting.
- `Deploy` persists this hex hash as the on‑chain address and stores the original bytecode, enabling reproducible builds and content‑addressable lookups across nodes.
- Registries such as `ContractRegistry`, `AIContractRegistry`, and `XContractRegistry` index contracts by this hex string, making it the universal reference for upgrades and cross‑chain mappings.
- CLI helpers like `contracts info` surface the hex address alongside metadata, while `opcodes hex` resolves function names to their 32‑bit hex opcodes for deterministic debugging.
- Opcode tables in `contracts_opcodes.go` and `snvm._opcodes.go` encode every VM function as a `0x` prefixed value. The `opcodeByName` helper and CLI tooling use these hex codes for gas accounting and interoperability audits.

## Contract Registry
- `ContractRegistry` maintains all deployed contracts in a concurrency‑safe map and exposes helper methods for listing or retrieving entries.
- `VirtualMachine` defines a minimal execution interface (`Execute`, `Start`, `Stop`, `Status`), allowing modular VM implementations.

## Contract Management
Administrative control is provided through `ContractManager`:
- **Transfer** – changes ownership of a contract without redeployment.
- **Pause/Resume** – toggles execution to mitigate emergencies or upgrades.
- **Upgrade** – replaces WASM bytecode and optionally adjusts gas limits while preserving the original address.
- **Info** – returns metadata including owner, manifest, gas limit, and paused status.

## Supported Languages and Tooling
`SupportedContractLanguages()` and `IsLanguageSupported` provide a canonical whitelist that the VM recognises for compilation and execution. The CLI selects the appropriate toolchain based on file extension and rejects anything outside this list.

| Language | Toolchain | Notes | Repository Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wasm/WAT** | Native ingestion | One‑to‑one mapping to opcodes for low‑level optimisation and testing | Pre‑compiled `.wasm` templates under `smart-contracts/` |
| **Go** | TinyGo → `wasm32-wasi` | Reuses Go libraries with deterministic builds and static analysis support | Example modules compiled into `.wasm` artifacts |
| **JavaScript/AssemblyScript** | AssemblyScript compiler | Enables rapid prototyping with TypeScript‑like syntax while emitting deterministic binaries | N/A (compiled outputs only) |
| **Solidity** | Solang cross‑compiler | Allows existing EVM contracts to target the Synnergy VM without major rewrites | Source library in `smart-contracts/solidity/` |
| **Rust** | Cargo (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) | Memory‑safe, high‑performance contracts; integrates with the `smart-contracts/rust` workspace | `smart-contracts/rust/` |
| **Python** | Pyodide/MicroPython transpilers | Favoured for AI and data‑science workloads where dynamic typing aids experimentation | Compiled WASM examples such as `ai_model_market.wasm` |
| **Yul** | Solidity Yul IR → WASM | Minimal intermediate representation for audit‑friendly, gas‑efficient bytecode | Used for specialised low‑level modules |

### Benefits of Multi‑Language Support

Polyglot contract authoring removes linguistic barriers and lets teams choose the toolchain that best matches their expertise. Web developers can contribute AssemblyScript modules, financial engineers can port Solidity code through Solang, and data scientists can ship Python‑driven AI models—all while targeting the same runtime.

Standardising on WebAssembly and a 64‑character hex address ensures these diverse languages interoperate seamlessly. Regardless of source language, `CompileWASM` produces identical bytecode and the same deterministic address, allowing audit tools and registries to treat every contract uniformly. This uniformity reduces migration friction from other chains, protects existing developer investments, and invites a global contributor base, ultimately making the Synnergy Network more universally accessible and resilient.

The command‑line interface enables lifecycle operations via `contracts compile|deploy|invoke|list|info` and surfaces syntax‑specific tips based on the selected language. Extending the set via `AddSupportedLanguage` allows future addition of languages such as Move or Vyper following the same deterministic pipeline.

## Opcode Architecture and Gas
- `ContractOpcodes` enumerates a stable opcode set spanning AI, governance, financial primitives, compliance, consensus, and bridging.
- Each opcode maps to a deterministic numeric identifier used in gas accounting and tooling, facilitating clear cost analysis across modules.
- `snvm._opcodes.go` mirrors this table for the broader VM, ensuring CLI `opcodes hex` queries and internal gas metering reference a single source of truth.

## AI‑Enhanced Contracts
- `AIContractRegistry` extends the base registry by associating deployed contracts with model hashes for inference.
- `DeployAIContract` stores both the WASM and corresponding AI model hash, while `InvokeAIContract` standardizes calling the `infer` method for on‑chain machine‑learning workflows.

## Cross‑Chain Contract Mapping
- `XContractRegistry` links local contract addresses to remote chains, supporting bidirectional interoperability.
- Mappings can be registered, listed, queried, and removed, enabling bridge modules to orchestrate cross‑chain calls with deterministic references.

## Sample Contract Library
- The repository ships with an extensive `smart-contracts/solidity` suite demonstrating tokens, DeFi primitives, governance systems, data oracles, AI marketplaces, and more.
- Examples include `AIModelMarket.sol`, `ArbitratedEscrow.sol`, `StakingRewards.sol`, `WeatherOracle.sol`, and `YieldFarm.sol`, offering production‑ready templates for rapid development.

## Security and Governance
- Deterministic addressing, per‑contract gas limits, and the ability to pause or upgrade contracts provide strong operational controls.
- Opcode segregation and language whitelisting assist regulators and auditors in verifying contract behavior within Blackridge Group Ltd.’s compliance framework.

## Conclusion
Through a modular registry, rich opcode vocabulary, AI integrations, and cross‑chain mapping, the Synnergy Network delivers a comprehensive contract ecosystem aligned with Blackridge Group Ltd.’s mission to power secure, interoperable, and intelligent blockchain solutions.

## Creditors

# Creditors

*Prepared for the Synnergy Network by **Blackridge Group Ltd.***

## Overview
Creditor nodes are licensed financial entities that inject regulated liquidity into the Synnergy Network. Operating under the Blackridge Group Ltd. governance model, they extend credit, originate debt instruments and steward on‑chain lending markets. Every creditor node maintains a verifiable identity, adheres to jurisdictional requirements and interfaces directly with the network's smart‑contract infrastructure. Enterprise‑grade controls govern onboarding, asset issuance, risk monitoring and operational resilience to ensure trust within global financial jurisdictions.

## Onboarding, Identity and Access Control
Before receiving lender privileges, each creditor establishes an auditable presence and is assigned protocol roles. The `IdentityService` records identity metadata and verification logs for network addresses, ensuring that only registered entities can operate【F:identity_verification.go†L22-L56】. Wallets are then registered through the `IDRegistry`, which binds addresses to descriptive metadata for traceability【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】. Role assignments are managed by the `AccessController`, which grants, revokes and checks permissions against a central registry【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】. Together, these modules enforce stringent entry requirements and allow Blackridge Group Ltd. to revoke rights if a creditor falls out of compliance.

## Credential Security and Data Channels
Enterprise creditors must protect operational keys and communications. The `BiometricsAuth` module enables hashed biometric templates so nodes can require physical verification for sensitive actions【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】. For data in transit, the `ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted channels and signs every payload, ensuring that audit messages and loan instructions remain tamper‑evident across distributed infrastructure【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L67】.

## Asset Issuance and Tokenisation
Approved creditors may issue regulated instruments ranging from bonds to real‑estate tokens. Token contracts embed compliance rules; for example, `SYN223Token` enforces whitelist and blacklist controls so transfers only occur between authorised participants【F:core/syn223_token.go†L8-L31】【F:core/syn223_token.go†L61-L76】. These safeguards ensure that assets minted on Synnergy remain traceable and fully compliant with jurisdictional mandates.

## Role in the Synnergy Network
- **Regulated instrument issuance** – Creditor nodes can mint instruments such as bonds, ETFs and real‑estate tokens. These capabilities are restricted to roles explicitly authorised in the protocol's role‑based access controls.
- **Liquidity provisioning** – Creditors supply capital to borrowers through smart contracts, ensuring transparent terms, automated enforcement and immutable audit trails.
- **Governance participation** – Creditors may vote on proposals affecting lending policy, treasury allocation and systemic risk parameters.

## Permissions and Responsibilities
Creditor privileges are tightly scoped to protect the ecosystem:

1. **Onboarding and verification** – Each creditor registers through dedicated wallets and passes identity validation before receiving the permissions required to operate.
2. **Token authority** – Only approved creditors may deploy bill tokens or participate in the issuance of SYN‑10/11/12 compliant assets.
3. **Treasury stewardship** – Creditors must manage funds responsibly and remain subject to community oversight, including potential revocation of rights for malpractice.
4. **Regulatory alignment** – All activity must comply with local financial regulations, with AI‑assisted monitoring detecting anomalies and flagging suspicious behaviour.

## LoanPool and Credit Workflows
The LoanPool module is the primary interface for extending credit within the network. It maintains a treasury and tracks proposals from submission through disbursement. Core capabilities include:

- **SubmitProposal** – creditors create loan offers defining recipients, amounts and descriptive terms.
- **VoteProposal** – authorised stakeholders vote on each proposal.
- **Tick** – periodic evaluation of proposals promotes those with sufficient votes.
- **Disburse** – upon approval and treasury availability, funds are released to borrowers.

A reference implementation of these functions resides in `core/loanpool.go` and exposes the workflow that creditor nodes follow when underwriting loans【F:core/loanpool.go†L26-L75】. Supporting modules refine this process:

- `LoanProposal` structures the request and voting state【F:core/loanpool_proposal.go†L5-L46】.
- `LoanPoolApply` manages simplified applications for retail borrowers, performing submission, voting, processing and disbursement against the same treasury【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L5-L82】.
- `LoanPoolManager` enables administrators to pause operations and retrieve aggregate statistics such as approved and disbursed counts【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L3-L44】.
- `LoanPoolViews` exposes serialisable JSON records for proposals and applications, simplifying dashboard integration and audit trails【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L52】【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L54-L96】.
- Command‑line tooling mirrors these workflows. The `loanpool` CLI submits, votes, disburses and amends proposals while the companion `loanpool_apply` CLI streamlines applications for mass onboarding【F:cli/loanpool.go†L15-L122】【F:cli/loanpool_apply.go†L15-L90】.

## Regulatory and Compliance Framework
Blackridge Group Ltd. enforces policy across the credit stack. The `RegulatoryManager` stores jurisdiction‑specific rules and evaluates transactions for violations【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L74】. `RegulatoryNode` instances consult these rules and flag non‑conforming entities before approving transfers【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】. At the operational level, the `ComplianceService` validates KYC commitments, records fraud signals and monitors transactions for anomalies, producing audit trails and risk scores for each address【F:compliance.go†L61-L124】. These records feed the persistent `AuditManager`, which logs events per address for later inspection, while scheduled reviews can be orchestrated through standardised scripts like `compliance_audit.sh`【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】【F:scripts/compliance_audit.sh†L1-L16】.

## AI‑Driven Risk Intelligence and Model Governance
Machine‑learning components augment human oversight. The `InferenceEngine` loads and executes deterministic models to score transactions for fraud risk【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L15-L46】, while the streaming `AnomalyDetector` computes z‑scores to surface atypical behaviour in real time【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. A `DriftMonitor` tracks model accuracy over time and flags performance degradation beyond configurable thresholds, enabling administrators to retrain or replace models【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L34】. Updated models are distributed through the on‑chain `ModelMarketplace`, which lists model hashes, CIDs and pricing for controlled deployment across creditor nodes【F:ai_model_management.go†L9-L46】. Together these modules supply continuous feedback into compliance systems and maintain model integrity throughout the network lifecycle.

## Operational Resilience
Enterprise creditors must maintain service even during outages. The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes backup nodes when the primary becomes unresponsive, providing high‑availability lending infrastructure【F:high_availability.go†L8-L70】.

## Security Monitoring and Audit Observability
A layered monitoring stack safeguards creditor operations. The `AuditManager` persists immutable event records, and the `AuditNode` exposes these logs to the network for tamper‑evident oversight【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】【F:core/audit_node.go†L12-L44】. Command‑line interfaces extend this functionality—`audit` records or lists events, while `audit_node` starts bootstrap services and streams logs for compliance teams【F:cli/audit.go†L15-L64】【F:cli/audit_node.go†L22-L79】. Runtime metrics and firewall rules further protect nodes: `SystemHealthLogger` captures CPU, memory and peer statistics for dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L40】, and `WatchtowerNode` combines these metrics with an embedded `Firewall` to block malicious addresses, tokens or IPs and report detected forks【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】【F:firewall.go†L5-L22】.

## Interoperability and Automation
Creditor services integrate with Synnergy’s cross‑chain layer so assets and repayments can traverse multiple networks. The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges, authorises relayers and tracks active links between chains【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L90】. Above this, the `TransactionManager` records lock‑mint and burn‑release transfers, creating immutable proofs that can be audited across participating chains【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】. Supporting components such as the `BridgeTransferManager` lock assets and release them upon proof submission, while the `ConnectionManager` opens and closes links between remote networks for fully auditable interoperability【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L66】【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L58】. Combined with the CLI interfaces above, these capabilities enable automated portfolios, scheduled disbursements and seamless inter‑network settlement.

## Transaction Control and Receipts
Creditor nodes manage high‑value transfers with deterministic tooling. Transactions can be scheduled for future execution, reversed through authority‑mediated votes within defined windows and even converted to private AES‑GCM payloads for confidential disbursement【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L136】. Every operation emits a `Receipt` that is stored and searchable, providing auditable trails for regulators and accounting teams【F:core/transaction_control.go†L160-L210】.

## Interaction with Other Nodes
Creditor nodes collaborate with authority, government and central bank nodes. Many decisions—especially those involving public funds from the LoanPool—require multi‑party approval. This layered consensus ensures that no single creditor can unilaterally manipulate liquidity or violate governance mandates.

## Contribution to the Ecosystem
By extending capital to individuals, businesses and public initiatives, creditors stimulate growth and enable broader adoption of the Synnergy Network. Their activities support grant programs, secured and unsecured lending, and ecosystem innovation funds, aligning financial incentives with community development.

## Summary
Creditors serve as the network's financial backbone, delivering regulated credit services through verifiable smart contracts and cooperative governance. Blackridge Group Ltd. recognises their role as essential to a resilient, transparent and inclusive digital economy.

## Cross chain

# Cross-Chain Interoperability

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd delivers the Synnergy Network as an enterprise-grade blockchain platform engineered for seamless interoperability across disparate ecosystems. Cross-chain capabilities allow assets, data, and contract logic to move securely between networks while maintaining deterministic gas costs and auditable records. This section details the primitives, processes, and tooling that power Synnergy's cross-chain functionality.

## Architectural Overview
Synnergy's cross-chain layer is composed of concurrency-safe managers and registries that coordinate bridges, connections, protocols, contracts, and transactions:

- **Bridge Registry (`cross_chain.go`)** – tracks configured links between source and target chains and maintains a whitelist of authorized relayers.
- **Bridge Transfer Manager (`cross_chain_bridge.go`)** – records deposits and claims, ensuring locked assets and released assets are paired with verifiable proofs.
- **Connection Manager (`cross_chain_connection.go`)** – opens and closes logical channels between chains and records their lifecycle.
- **Cross-Chain Protocol Registry (`cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go`)** – catalogs protocol standards understood by external networks, enabling agnostic communication.
- **Cross-Chain Contract Registry (`cross_chain_contracts.go`)** – maps local contract addresses to their counterparts on remote chains for seamless contract invocation.
- **Transaction Manager (`cross_chain_transactions.go`)** – persists lock‑mint and burn‑release operations for full auditability.
- **Consensus Network Manager (`cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go`)** – registers connections between heterogeneous consensus systems to coordinate cross-consensus scaling networks.

All managers leverage SHA‑256 identifiers and thread-safe maps, creating a deterministic and performant foundation that can be swapped for persistent databases in production deployments.

## Bridge Configuration & Relayer Governance
Bridges are registered with a source chain, target chain, and optional initial relayer. The `CrossChainManager` exposes methods to:

- Register new bridges and retrieve existing configurations.
- Authorize or revoke relayer addresses across all bridges.
- Verify relayer authorization before accepting transfer instructions.

This governance model gives Blackridge operators fine-grained control over who can initiate cross-chain actions, supporting regulatory compliance and operational security.

## Connection Lifecycle Management
The `ConnectionManager` maintains the lifecycle of cross-chain links. Connections are opened with deterministic IDs and can be cleanly closed when no longer needed. Timestamps for opening and closing events provide a historical record of inter-network connectivity, aiding monitoring and forensic analysis.

## Cross-Chain Protocol Registry
Interoperability often requires common message formats. The `ProtocolRegistry` stores canonical protocol definitions, each assigned a unique identifier. Networks can query the registry to negotiate supported standards, ensuring Synnergy remains agnostic to underlying consensus algorithms or data encodings.

## Cross-Consensus Scaling Networks
Some deployments span chains using distinct consensus mechanisms. The `ConsensusNetworkManager` tracks these cross-consensus links, assigning identifiers and storing the source and target consensus models. Operators can register, list, retrieve, or remove networks to orchestrate horizontal scaling strategies that bridge proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or Byzantine fault tolerant domains【F:core/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L8-L69】.

## Contract Interoperability Layer
Through the `XContractRegistry`, Synnergy maps local smart contract addresses to remote deployments. DApps can look up these mappings to invoke functions on other chains without hardcoding addresses. Removing or updating mappings is supported, allowing contracts to evolve as external ecosystems change.

## Asset Transfer Flows
Two primary operations move value across networks:

1. **Lock‑Mint** – Native assets are locked on the source chain while wrapped representations are minted on a destination chain. The `TransactionManager` records the event, and `BridgeTransferManager` tracks the locked funds.
2. **Burn‑Release** – Wrapped tokens are burned, and the corresponding native assets are released. Proofs supplied during the claim process prevent double-spends and confirm completion.

Every transfer is assigned a cryptographic ID, includes participant addresses, amounts, asset identifiers, and timestamps, and may embed proofs for later verification. These records enable full reconciliation and dispute resolution.

## Data Structures and Ledger Integration
Synnergy’s cross-chain subsystem is built on explicit, strongly typed records that preserve state for forensic review and ledger reconciliation:

- **Bridge** structures store source and target chain identifiers alongside a dynamic relayer whitelist, all guarded by read–write mutexes for thread safety【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L48】.
- **BridgeTransfer** entries capture deposit and claim metadata, including token identifiers, cryptographic proofs, and creation timestamps to trace asset custody end-to-end【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L67】.
- **Ledger-integrated BridgeManager** debits depositors into a `bridge_escrow` account and credits recipients upon claim verification, preserving collateralization of bridged assets【F:core/cross_chain_bridge.go†L107-L143】.
- **ChainConnection** records persist the lifecycle of inter-network links with open and close timestamps so operators can audit historical connectivity【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L58】.
- **XContractMapping** objects map local contract addresses to remote destinations, allowing DApps to invoke off-chain logic without hard-coded dependencies【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L5-L31】【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L34-L57】.
- **CrossChainTransaction** logs classify transfers as `lockmint` or `burnrelease`, embedding amounts, proofs, and recipient addresses for deterministic replay【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】.
- **Ledger-bound transfers** use `CrossChainTxManager` to debit and credit accounts while recording transaction type and completion status, ensuring wrapped assets remain backed by on-chain collateral【F:core/cross_chain_transactions.go†L43-L76】.

## Security and Auditability
Security is embedded at every layer:

- **Relayer Whitelisting** – Only authorized relayers can interact with bridges, reducing attack surfaces.
- **Proof-Based Claims** – Assets locked for bridging require a valid proof before release, enforcing integrity across chains.
- **Concurrency Safety** – Mutexes protect all registries, avoiding race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
- **Deterministic Gas Accounting** – Each operation exposes a predictable gas cost, simplifying fee estimation and budgeting.

Comprehensive audit trails support regulatory requirements and internal governance for enterprises leveraging Synnergy.

## Gas Pricing and VM Opcode Mapping
All cross-chain operations are assigned deterministic gas costs that load from `gas_table_list.md` during start‑up. Pricing entries cover bridge registration, deposits, claims, connection management, protocol registration, contract mapping and transfer execution, allowing wallets to predict fees before submission【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L708-L717】.

The Synnergy virtual machine exposes dedicated opcodes for these actions—such as `RegisterXContract`, `RecordCrossChainTx`, and `OpenChainConnection`—so smart contracts and CLIs execute the same primitives through a unified interface【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L175-L190】.

## Compliance and Monitoring
Relayer governance, immutable transfer logs, and connection histories give regulators and internal auditors complete traceability. By pairing relayer authorization with cryptographically verifiable proofs, the platform satisfies enterprise compliance mandates while enabling real-time monitoring across multiple ledgers.

## Tooling and Automation
The Synnergy CLI ecosystem equips operators with granular control over every interoperability primitive:

- **`cross_chain`** registers bridges, lists configurations, and manages relayer authorizations, outputting human-readable or JSON summaries with gas estimates【F:cli/cross_chain.go†L15-L99】.
- **`cross_chain_bridge`** locks assets and claims releases while exposing transfer records and deterministic gas pricing for each step【F:cli/cross_chain_bridge.go†L16-L112】.
- **`cross_chain_connection`** establishes or terminates inter-network links and retrieves connection status with optional JSON encoding【F:cli/cross_chain_connection.go†L15-L110】.
- **`cross_chain_agnostic_protocols`** registers protocol definitions and enumerates supported standards for handshake negotiation【F:cli/cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go†L15-L88】.
- **`xcontract`** registers, lists, retrieves, or removes cross-chain contract mappings, enabling dynamic contract upgrades【F:cli/cross_chain_contracts.go†L15-L100】.
- **`cross_tx`** executes lock‑mint and burn‑release transfers, retrieves individual transactions, and lists historical records with optional JSON formatting【F:cli/cross_chain_transactions.go†L15-L126】.
- **`cross-consensus`** provisions, lists, queries, and removes networks that bridge distinct consensus mechanisms, enabling orchestrated scaling across heterogeneous chains【F:cli/cross_consensus_scaling_networks.go†L15-L109】.

Collectively these tools integrate with automation frameworks and dashboards, allowing Blackridge Group clients to orchestrate cross‑chain workflows programmatically.


## Smart Contract Bridge Templates
Reference bridge contracts in Solidity and Rust demonstrate how external networks can lock assets and authorize releases under administrator control. The Solidity `CrossChainBridge` emits `Locked` and `Released` events around ERC‑20 transfers【F:smart-contracts/solidity/CrossChainBridge.sol†L9-L31】, while the Rust implementation models escrow balances and enforces admin-only releases for Wasm environments【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/cross_chain_bridge.rs†L3-L26】.

## Use Cases and Business Applications
Cross-chain interoperability unlocks numerous enterprise scenarios:

- **Asset Mobility** – Move value between public and private chains to access liquidity or compliance zones.
- **Hybrid Deployments** – Invoke contracts on specialized chains while maintaining a unified ledger.
- **Regulatory Partitioning** – Segregate sensitive transactions onto permissioned networks while mirroring state to public chains for transparency.
- **Cross-Market Settlement** – Bridge digital securities, stablecoins, or tokenized goods across trading venues.

## Future Outlook
Blackridge Group Ltd continues to expand Synnergy's cross-chain toolkit with advanced relayer consensus, external light‑client verification, and persistent storage integrations. These enhancements will further reduce trust assumptions and streamline enterprise adoption.

By providing a secure, modular, and governance-driven approach to interoperability, Synnergy empowers organizations to leverage multiple blockchains without sacrificing control or compliance.

## Exchanges

# Exchanges

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered and operated by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, enables fluid exchange of value across tokens, liquidity pools and external chains. Exchange mechanics are built directly into the protocol to support enterprise settlement, retail trading and cross‑border payments without compromising security or regulatory auditability.

## Token Standards Driving Exchange
### SYN10 – Central Bank Digital Currency
`SYN10Token` embeds a concurrency‑safe ledger and tracks issuer information alongside a mutable fiat exchange rate, allowing central banks to adjust parity while preserving total supply data【F:internal/tokens/syn10.go†L1-L41】.

### SYN3400 – Forex Pair Registry
The `ForexRegistry` registers currency pairs and records time‑stamped rate updates so markets can query live foreign‑exchange data or integrate external price feeds【F:internal/tokens/syn3400.go†L10-L44】. Operators manage pairs via the `syn3400` CLI, which requires explicit base and quote currencies and a positive rate when registering new entries【F:cli/syn3400.go†L19-L42】.

### SYN3500 – Stable Value Token
`SYN3500Token` models centrally issued or asset‑backed stablecoins with an adjustable exchange rate and mint/redeem hooks for monetary policy control【F:core/syn3500_token.go†L8-L41】. Operators configure the currency via the `syn3500` CLI, which enforces non‑empty name, symbol and issuer fields and a positive exchange rate during initialization, while guarding rate updates and balance operations with explicit validation【F:cli/syn3500_token.go†L19-L92】.

### SYN3600 – Futures Contract
`FuturesContract` records the underlying asset, quantity, entry price and expiration for derivative positions, settling against a market price to compute profit or loss【F:core/syn3600.go†L9-L29】. The `syn3600` CLI requires an underlying asset, positive quantity and price, and a valid RFC3339 expiration while exposing status and settlement commands for managing positions【F:cli/syn3600.go†L20-L83】.

### SYN3700 – Index Token
`SYN3700Token` aggregates multiple assets into a weighted index and calculates composite values from supplied price data【F:core/syn3700_token.go†L8-L50】. Operators manage index composition through the `syn3700` CLI, which validates initialization, component weights, listing, valuation and removal commands for deterministic index management【F:cli/syn3700_token.go†L15-L120】.

### SYN3800 – Grant Token
`GrantRegistry` manages programmatic grants, recording beneficiary, name, amount and release notes, while the `syn3800` CLI validates inputs, disburses funds and exposes JSON queries for grant details and listings【F:core/syn3800.go†L8-L56】【F:cli/syn3800.go†L20-L89】.

### SYN3900 – Government Benefit Token
`BenefitRegistry` tracks government benefit allocations and claim status. The `syn3900` CLI enforces recipient and program fields, requires positive amounts, supports claims and returns structured benefit data for auditing【F:core/syn3900.go†L8-L51】【F:cli/syn3900.go†L20-L75】.

### SYN4200 – Charity Token
`SYN4200Token` logs donations per campaign and reports raised totals. The `syn4200_token` CLI requires donor addresses and positive amounts, recording contributions and querying progress directly from the command line【F:core/syn4200_token.go†L7-L42】【F:cli/syn4200_token.go†L18-L52】.

### SYN4700 – Legal Process Token
`LegalToken` binds hashed legal documents, participant signatures and dispute history. Operators manage tokens with the `syn4700` CLI, which validates creation parameters, signature management, status changes and dispute logging while outputting JSON for downstream inspection【F:core/syn4700.go†L9-L146】【F:cli/syn4700.go†L20-L160】.

### SYN500 – Utility Token
`SYN500Token` assigns service tiers with usage quotas, and the `syn500` CLI enforces required metadata and positive values when creating tokens, granting tiers and recording consumption【F:core/syn500.go†L5-L43】【F:cli/syn500.go†L17-L69】.

### SYN2100 – Trade‑Finance Liquidity
`TradeFinanceToken` tracks invoices and maintains pooled liquidity balances, enabling financiers to deposit or withdraw capital against on‑chain trade documents【F:core/syn2100.go†L9-L107】.

### SYN20 – Programmable Utility Token
`SYN20Token` extends the base token model with enterprise safeguards such as global pause controls and address‑level freezing, enabling regulated markets to halt or quarantine balances without disrupting accounting integrity【F:internal/tokens/syn20.go†L8-L63】.

### SYN223 – Whitelist/Blacklist Enforcement
For jurisdictions requiring strict participant vetting, `SYN223Token` enforces whitelist and blacklist policies during every transfer and exposes administrative tooling to revoke or approve counterparties in real time【F:internal/tokens/syn223_token.go†L8-L78】.

## Decentralised Exchange Infrastructure
### Constant‑Product Automated Market Maker
A native AMM supports token swaps and liquidity provisioning through a constant‑product formula. Pools track reserves, fee basis points and LP balances while guarding state with mutexes for deterministic settlement. Liquidity providers receive LP tokens proportional to their contribution, and swaps deduct fees before recomputing the invariant `k = x*y` to derive deterministic output amounts【F:core/liquidity_pools.go†L9-L106】.

### Liquidity Views and Monitoring
`LiquidityPoolView` snapshots pool state for read‑only inspection, powering dashboards and the DEX screener to surface reserves and fees in real time【F:core/liquidity_views.go†L1-L24】.

### CLI and GUI Tooling
Operators interact with pools using the `liquidity_pools` CLI to create pools, add liquidity, execute swaps or remove positions【F:cli/liquidity_pools.go†L12-L99】. The companion `liquidity_views` commands list pools or display individual metrics for monitoring interfaces【F:cli/liquidity_views.go†L10-L33】. A convenience command `dex liquidity <pair>` exposes on‑chain reserves for external tooling and GUIs【F:README.md†L140-L146】.

### Opcode and Gas Integration
Liquidity management and view operations are exposed as first‑class SNVM opcodes, allowing automated market tools and smart contracts to invoke pool creation, swaps and snapshot queries with deterministic gas pricing【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L846-L854】【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L994-L996】.

## Cross‑Chain Asset Exchange
### Bridge and Relayer Management
The `CrossChainManager` registers bridges between networks and authorises relayer addresses, enabling controlled asset flows across heterogeneous chains【F:cross_chain.go†L10-L49】.

### Transfer Lifecycle
`BridgeTransferManager` locks deposits, tracks proofs and releases claims, while the `TransactionManager` records lock‑and‑mint or burn‑and‑release events for full auditability【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L66】【F:cross_chain_transactions.go†L10-L65】.

### Connection Tracking
The `ConnectionManager` logs opening and closing of links between chains, preserving historical metadata so enterprise operators can audit when and where cross‑network channels were active【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L77】.

### CLI Automation
Bridge configuration, transfer deposits and claims are automated through dedicated CLIs that return gas metrics and optional JSON for integration. `cross_chain` manages bridge registration and relayer authorization, while `cross_chain_bridge` handles deposits, proofs and ledger queries【F:cli/cross_chain.go†L15-L99】【F:cli/cross_chain_bridge.go†L16-L112】.

## Security, Compliance and Governance
### Transaction Integrity
Exchange‑rate updates and liquidity operations are guarded by mutexes and explicit error checks, ensuring thread‑safe accounting and preventing unauthorized withdrawals【F:core/syn3500_token.go†L26-L41】【F:core/syn2100.go†L92-L107】. Token standards add further controls: `SYN20Token` can pause mint/burn and freeze individual addresses, and `SYN223Token` rejects transfers unless recipients are whitelisted and not blacklisted【F:internal/tokens/syn20.go†L24-L88】【F:internal/tokens/syn223_token.go†L33-L76】. Bridge managers capture proofs and state transitions so regulators can reconcile cross‑chain events against authoritative logs【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L35-L66】.

### Compliance Enforcement and KYC
The `ComplianceManager` centrally records suspended addresses and whitelists, reviewing each transaction to block interactions with flagged parties【F:core/compliance_management.go†L10-L76】. Enterprise operators extend these rules from the command line through the `compliance` CLI, which validates and erases KYC documents, records fraud signals, audits account histories and runs anomaly detection or ZKP verification with optional JSON output for SIEM pipelines【F:cli/compliance.go†L31-L160】.

### Regulatory Oversight
Jurisdictional policy is codified by `RegulatoryManager`, which stores per‑region rules such as transaction limits and evaluates them for violations【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】. `RegulatoryNode` instances apply these rules in real time, flagging offending addresses and preserving an immutable log for external auditors【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L50】.

### Transaction Controls and Privacy
Enterprises can schedule transactions for future execution or cancellation, freeze funds for authority‑approved reversals and encrypt payloads using AES‑GCM for confidential settlement【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L136】.

### Deterministic Gas Accounting
A central gas table enumerates opcode costs so wallets, CLIs and monitoring systems can price liquidity operations, bridge transfers and compliance checks deterministically across the network【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】.

## Future Roadmap
A dedicated `TokenExchange` smart contract scaffold is reserved for advanced DEX logic, including order books and programmatic fee routing【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenExchange.sol†L1-L6】.

## Conclusion
Through integrated token standards, AMM liquidity pools and cross‑chain bridges, the Synnergy Network by **Blackridge Group Ltd.** delivers a comprehensive, regulated environment for exchanging digital and real‑world assets. Ongoing work on exchange contracts and monitoring tooling will further expand market depth and interoperability across the ecosystem.

## Faucet

# Token Faucet

Blackridge Group Ltd. provides a controlled token faucet within the Synnergy Network to dispense small amounts of test assets for development, onboarding, and QA activities. This document details the faucet's architecture, operational model, and usage patterns across the stack.

## Design Objectives

- **Developer enablement** – offer a reliable source of tokens for sandbox environments without jeopardising monetary policy.
- **Abuse resistance** – enforce deterministic rate limiting and balance checks to prevent draining the faucet.
- **Configurability** – allow administrators to tune dispense amounts and cooldown periods to match network conditions.

## Core Implementation

The faucet is implemented as a thread‑safe Go service. It maintains an internal balance, a fixed dispense amount, a cooldown duration, and a record of the last request per address【F:faucet.go†L10-L17】. Requests are processed atomically to ensure consistent state updates【F:faucet.go†L27-L37】. Administrators may update operational parameters at runtime, enabling dynamic governance of distribution policies【F:faucet.go†L48-L53】.

### Data Model and Concurrency

The service stores requester timestamps in a map keyed by address to enforce rate limits【F:faucet.go†L11-L16】. Incoming requests acquire a mutex before checking balance and cooldown status, preventing race conditions under heavy load【F:faucet.go†L27-L34】. Error messages surface distinct causes such as an empty balance or premature requests, aiding automated clients in retry logic【F:faucet.go†L30-L35】.

A mirrored implementation exists under the `core` package for integration with higher‑level services. It exposes the same request and configuration semantics, internally sourcing timestamps to simplify call sites【F:core/faucet.go†L28-L41】.

## Command‑Line Interface

Operational control is exposed through the Synnergy CLI. The `faucet` command group, built on the Cobra framework, provides subcommands to initialise the faucet, request tokens, inspect remaining balance, and update configuration parameters【F:cli/faucet.go†L13-L83】. Each subcommand emits human‑readable responses and non‑zero exit codes on failure, enabling automation scripts to handle retries or escalate errors.

### Key Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `faucet init --balance <n> --amount <n> --cooldown <d>` | Deploys a faucet instance with an initial balance, dispense amount, and cooldown duration. |
| `faucet request <address>` | Attempts to send the configured amount to the target address. Errors are surfaced when the faucet is uninitialised or the cooldown has not elapsed【F:cli/faucet.go†L39-L47】. |
| `faucet balance` | Displays the remaining faucet balance. |
| `faucet config --amount <n> --cooldown <d>` | Updates the dispense amount and cooldown period for subsequent requests, allowing real‑time tuning of output rates【F:cli/faucet.go†L67-L82】. |

Default flag values (balance `1000`, amount `1`, cooldown `1m`) accelerate local onboarding by providing sensible startup parameters【F:cli/faucet.go†L30-L33】.

Administrators may reconfigure live instances using `faucet config`, which immediately updates the in‑memory limits without service restarts【F:cli/faucet.go†L67-L83】. Commands guard against uninitialised use and return contextual messages such as "faucet not initialised" or detailed error strings from the service layer【F:cli/faucet.go†L39-L47】【F:cli/faucet.go†L55-L60】.

### Automation and Scripts

A helper script, `faucet_fund.sh`, simplifies repeated funding requests from shell environments【F:cmd/scripts/faucet_fund.sh†L1-L7】. It validates that a destination address is supplied and then proxies the request through the CLI. An accompanying deployment scaffold (`scripts/deploy_faucet_contract.sh`) outlines the planned automation for rolling out faucet contracts in regulated environments and exposes a `--help` flag for future extensibility【F:scripts/deploy_faucet_contract.sh†L1-L16】.

## Smart Contract Implementations

For on‑chain scenarios, Blackridge supplies a reference Solidity contract `TokenFaucet.sol`. It exposes immutable token binding, owner identification, a configurable drip amount, and a 24‑hour wait period between requests【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L10-L27】. Anyone may deposit additional liquidity, while only the owner may modify the drip rate or withdraw balances【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L31-L45】.

An equivalent model is provided in Rust for WebAssembly targets, enabling cross‑platform faucet deployments with consistent semantics. The Rust struct records the owner, per‑call drip amount, and wait interval, tracking last request timestamps in a `HashMap` to enforce cooldowns【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/token_faucet.rs†L1-L23】. The compiled artefact (`smart-contracts/token_faucet.wasm`) allows the same logic to execute within Synnergy's WASM runtime.

### Virtual Machine and Gas Integration

Faucet operations are first‑class citizens within the Synnergy Virtual Machine. Opcode mappings register creation, requests, balance queries, and configuration updates, ensuring transactions can invoke faucet functions deterministically【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L596-L644】. Both the `core` and top‑level faucet APIs receive dedicated opcode numbers (`0x000245`–`0x000275`), giving tooling a stable interface for contract invocation【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L596-L644】. Corresponding gas prices are tracked so dashboards can forecast the cost of deploying faucet templates alongside other smart‑contract modules【F:gas_table.go†L18-L29】.

## Testing Coverage

Automated tests validate faucet interactions through the CLI by deploying the token faucet template and verifying its registration within the contract registry【F:tests/contracts/faucet_test.go†L43-L60】. The harness captures both stdout and stderr to assert that the deployment address is surfaced and subsequently listed, establishing end‑to‑end coverage from command invocation to registry persistence【F:tests/contracts/faucet_test.go†L14-L40】. These tests also ensure gas schedules are loaded prior to execution, aligning with the broader Synnergy virtual machine framework. Additional unit tests for the in‑memory Go service are scaffolded and will expand coverage as enterprise requirements mature【F:faucet_test.go†L1-L6】.

## Operational Workflow

1. **Initialisation** – create the faucet with a defined balance, dispense amount, and cooldown.
2. **Funding** – deposit test tokens if using the on‑chain implementation.
3. **Request Cycle** – participants invoke `faucet request` to receive the drip amount. The system records timestamps per address to enforce waiting periods.
4. **Monitoring** – administrators periodically inspect `faucet balance` and adjust parameters through `faucet config` as required.

## Security Considerations

- **Rate Limiting** – cooldown tracking mitigates automated draining attempts.
- **Balance Safeguards** – requests are denied when the faucet lacks sufficient funds, preserving deterministic behaviour.
- **Owner Controls** – smart contract variants restrict administrative actions (parameter changes, withdrawals) to the contract owner, while permitting third‑party deposits to replenish reserves【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L31-L45】.
- **Clear Failure Modes** – the Go service returns discrete error strings such as "faucet empty" or "cooldown period not met" so API gateways can differentiate abuse from legitimate exhaustion【F:faucet.go†L30-L35】.
- **Mutable Rate Limits** – live configuration updates via the CLI allow operators to throttle traffic during incidents without redeploying services【F:cli/faucet.go†L67-L83】.

## Enterprise Deployment Considerations

- **Persistence and Scaling** – the reference implementation maintains state in memory; production deployments should persist balances and request logs in a replicated datastore to survive restarts and enable horizontal scaling.
- **Observability** – integration with the Synnergy telemetry stack allows operators to export metrics on request rates and error counts, supporting proactive capacity planning.
- **Access Mediation** – public endpoints should layer CAPTCHA or signature schemes on top of the default cooldown logic to resist sybil attacks and scripted abuse.
- **Governance and Audit** – immutable request logs and administrator actions should feed central audit trails so compliance teams can reconstruct allocation histories and enforce policy boundaries.
- **Disaster Recovery** – backups of faucet state and configuration should be replicated across regions to ensure continuity during data‑centre failures.
- **Operational Boundaries** – when multiple teams share infrastructure, deploy isolated faucet instances or namespace controls to prevent cross‑tenant interference.

## Future Enhancements

Road‑map items include integrating CAPTCHA or signature verification for public endpoints, metric export for observability, and optional identity checks through Synnergy's `syn900` modules.

## Conclusion

The Blackridge Group Ltd. faucet provides a configurable and secure mechanism for distributing test tokens across the Synnergy Network. By combining lightweight Go services, CLI tooling, and smart‑contract implementations, the system ensures developers and stakeholders can experiment safely while maintaining governance over token issuance.

## Fault tolerance

# Fault Tolerance

Blackridge Group Ltd's Synnergy network is engineered for continuous operation even in the presence of software faults, hardware failures, or malicious activity. The platform combines proactive monitoring, redundant infrastructure, and secure isolation to maintain service availability and data integrity.

## Failover and High Availability

- **Automatic node promotion.** The `FailoverManager` tracks heartbeat timestamps for a primary and its backups, promoting the most recently responsive node when the primary exceeds a configurable timeout【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.
- **Orchestrated replication.** Kubernetes manifests provision multiple node replicas with health probes to enable rolling upgrades and rapid recovery from pod failure【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L47】.
- **Elastic scaling.** Terraform auto‑scaling groups maintain a baseline of Synnergy nodes across availability zones and automatically replace failed instances to preserve quorum【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L21-L94】.

## Replication and Data Distribution

- **Ledger propagation.** The `Replicator` spreads new blocks or snapshots to peers, maintaining a record of hashes that have successfully propagated【F:core/replication.go†L5-L49】.
- **Initialization service.** `InitService` wraps the replicator, bootstrapping a ledger and exposing start/stop controls for command‑line management【F:core/initialization_replication.go†L5-L37】.
- **Content availability.** `DataDistribution` tracks which nodes offer a given dataset, removing entries when no replicas remain to avoid stale pointers【F:data_distribution.go†L5-L71】.
- **In‑memory indexing.** `IndexingNode` mirrors ledger state into a key/value store so nodes can reconstruct query indexes instantly after a restart【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L33】.
- **Snapshot feeds.** `DataFeed` captures external dataset updates with timestamps, providing a consistent recovery point for off‑chain information【F:data_operations.go†L8-L45】.

## Backup and State Recovery

- **Compressed snapshots.** `CompressLedger` and companion utilities persist the entire ledger as gzip‑compressed JSON, enabling portable backups and rapid restoration without replaying every block【F:core/blockchain_compression.go†L20-L84】.

## Continuous Monitoring and Fault Detection

- **Watchtower oversight.** `WatchtowerNode` instances run separate monitoring loops that collect runtime metrics and log detected forks, ensuring rapid visibility into network anomalies【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L86】.
- **Runtime metrics.** `SystemHealthLogger` gathers goroutine counts, memory usage, peer count, and block height to provide a real‑time health snapshot for operations teams【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L44】.
- **Failover validation.** Unit tests simulate missed heartbeats to confirm that backups become active when primaries stall【F:high_availability_test.go†L8-L21】.

## Predictive Analytics and Self-Healing

- **Streaming anomaly scoring.** `AnomalyDetector` maintains running mean and variance to flag outliers beyond a configurable z‑score threshold, allowing nodes to quarantine unstable components before issues cascade【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.
- **Model drift sensing.** `DriftMonitor` records baseline accuracy for deployed models and reports deviations that exceed tolerances, prompting automated retraining or rollback before bad predictions propagate【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.
- **Environmental triggers.** `EnvironmentalMonitoringNode` ingests sensor readings and evaluates rule‑based conditions, enabling automatic shutdown or migration when physical factors threaten hardware integrity【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L65】.

## Security and Isolation for Resilience

- **Network firewalling.** The `Firewall` component maintains blocklists for wallets, tokens, and IPs, allowing addresses to be quarantined without touching the rest of the system【F:firewall.go†L5-L103】.
- **Zero‑trust channels.** `ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted, signed data channels so compromised peers cannot tamper with or replay messages【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L113】.
- **Sandboxed execution.** The `SandboxManager` creates isolated environments for smart contracts, enforcing gas and memory limits and allowing faulty sandboxes to be reset or deleted without affecting others【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

## Cross‑Chain Fallback Paths

- `ConnectionManager` records active links to external blockchains, enabling transactions to be rerouted or isolated if the primary chain experiences instability【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L42】.

## Holographic Data Resilience

- **Erasure-coded storage.** `SplitHolographic` divides payloads into multiple shards that can be distributed across disparate nodes so that any subset of surviving shards can be reassembled into the original data set【F:holographic.go†L3-L24】.
- **Lossless reconstruction.** `ReconstructHolographic` concatenates available shards to restore the original byte stream, allowing services to recover files even when some replicas are missing【F:holographic.go†L26-L36】.

## Stake‑Based Quarantine and Slashing

- **Penalty tracking.** `StakePenaltyManager` maintains validator stakes, accrued penalty points, and an immutable history of `PenaltyRecord` entries so operators can rapidly isolate nodes that violate protocol guarantees【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L52】.
- **Automated restitution.** Authorized controllers adjust stake levels through `AdjustStake`, enabling collateral to be reduced or replenished based on audit findings without disrupting healthy participants【F:stake_penalty.go†L32-L39】.

## Operational Runbooks and Health Snapshots

- **Fault check script.** The `fault_check.sh` utility invokes the `system_health snapshot` command to capture point-in-time metrics for diagnostics and post‑mortem analysis【F:cmd/scripts/fault_check.sh†L1-L4】.

## Adaptive Consensus and Recovery

`ConsensusHopper` evaluates transaction throughput, network latency, and validator participation to select the most resilient consensus algorithm at runtime, enabling graceful degradation under stress【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L70】.

## Validation and Testing for Enterprise Reliability

- **End‑to‑end harness.** Integration tests start the wallet server, broadcast transactions, and verify propagation across multiple nodes, exercising the full stack under realistic conditions【F:tests/e2e/network_harness_test.go†L43-L98】.
- **Fuzzing campaigns.** Network fuzz tests continuously supply malformed inputs to surface edge‑case failures before they reach production【F:tests/fuzz/network_fuzz_test.go†L5-L7】.

## Governance and Auditability

- **Identity verification.** `IdentityService` registers participants and logs verification events to maintain accountable user provenance during recovery workflows【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L56】.
- **Regulatory oversight.** `RegulatoryNode` evaluates transactions against policy rules and flags suspicious entities for follow‑up, preserving an auditable trail even amid network disruptions【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】.

## Conclusion

Through layered redundancy, rigorous monitoring, strong isolation boundaries, and formal governance controls, Blackridge Group Ltd's Synnergy network delivers a fault‑tolerant foundation for decentralised applications. The combination of automated failover, replicated data services, adaptive consensus, exhaustive testing, and hardened security controls ensures that mission‑critical workloads remain available even when components fail or adversaries attempt disruption.

## GUIs

# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

Blackridge Group Ltd. maintains a portfolio of enterprise‑grade graphical front‑ends that extend the Synnergy command‑line interface. Each package is built on a strict Node.js 18 and TypeScript foundation, enforced by ESLint, Prettier, Jest and `ts-jest`. Multi‑stage Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests and Makefiles provide reproducible builds, while GitHub Actions mirror local workflows so every branch can ship with confidence.

## Platform Architecture and Enterprise Standards
- **CLI Fidelity** – GUIs call the same `synnergy` binaries as automation scripts, guaranteeing identical transaction semantics across browser, desktop and server environments.
- **TypeScript Baseline** – `tsconfig.json` files enable `strict` mode and modern ECMAScript targets, with Jest and Supertest exercising both functional paths and HTTP endpoints.
- **Environment‑Driven Configuration** – `.env.example` templates and `config/production.ts` files expose `API_URL`, `PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DB_URL` and related knobs, allowing behaviour to be tuned without code changes.
- **Security Posture** – Non‑root containers, CORS/Helmet middleware, and explicit dependency locking protect each surface. Kubernetes resources specify liveness/readiness probes and resource quotas.
- **Quality and Delivery** – Makefiles and npm scripts standardise install, lint, test, build and release steps. GitHub Actions pipelines (`ci/pipeline.yml`) run these tasks on every push.
- **Observability Ready** – Modules emit structured logs via Winston and expose health endpoints, enabling integration with enterprise telemetry stacks.

## Governance

# Governance

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs Synnergy Network governance as a layered system that blends on‑chain transparency with off‑chain accountability. Authority nodes, token holders and automated services cooperate through audited smart‑contract logic to steer protocol evolution while preserving security and regulatory compliance.

## Governance Architecture
- **Authority Nodes** – regulated entities that validate proposals and execute approved changes. They operate dedicated tooling and are subject to continuous monitoring. The core `AuthorityNodeRegistry` catalogs addresses, assigns roles, records votes and can sample a weighted electorate for committee formation【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L12-L95】.
- **Token‑Weighted Voting** – community participants wield governance tokens to propose upgrades, delegate voting power and ratify decisions.
- **Modular Services** – audit logging, replay protection and weight registries are implemented as isolated modules that can be composed into higher‑level governance applications.
- **Authenticated Membership** – the `dao-members` CLI validates ECDSA signatures and emits JSON when modifying roles, enabling auditable access control.

## Governance Tokens
### SYN300 – Proposal and Voting Engine
The SYN300 governance token exposes delegation, proposal management and quorum‑based execution. Holders may delegate or revoke voting rights, query effective voting power, register proposals and cast approvals or rejections. Proposals can be inspected or listed for external review, and finalisation is gated behind explicit quorum checks that aggregate delegated balances, ensuring accountable decision making【F:core/syn300_token.go†L43-L134】.

### SYN3600 – Weight Ledger
SYN3600 maintains a lightweight ledger of voting weights. Administrators assign and query address weights, enabling bespoke governance models such as council memberships or tiered franchises and providing a primitive for off‑chain registries to synchronise with on‑chain voting weight【F:internal/tokens/syn3600.go†L5-L27】.

### Staking Node – Governance Locking
`StakingNode` locks and releases tokens for governance or validation, tracking individual balances and the network’s total stake so quorum thresholds and eligibility rules can reference verifiable on‑chain tallies【F:core/staking_node.go†L5-L52】.

## Authority Node Registry
Authority nodes are catalogued in a registry that supports add, remove, get and list operations. Each record stores the node’s address, assigned role and a map of votes cast by participants, allowing regulators to audit decision provenance and rotate participants with minimal overhead【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L34-L128】.

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Delegation** – token holders optionally delegate voting power to trusted representatives.
2. **Submission** – a proposer registers a new governance proposal with descriptive metadata.
3. **Voting** – participants cast approvals or rejections; delegated balances are automatically counted.
4. **Execution** – when the approval voting power exceeds the configured quorum, proposals are finalised and enacted.

CLI tooling streamlines these steps. `governance_setup.sh` invokes the network binary with a proposal title and body file, while a lightweight wrapper `governance_propose.sh` offers quick submissions from development environments【F:scripts/governance_setup.sh†L1-L12】【F:cmd/scripts/governance_propose.sh†L1-L5】.

## Governance Contracts
Synnergy Network distributes governance contract templates to anchor decision making directly on-chain. The Solidity-based `DaoGovernance` contract defines a proposal struct with vote counts, execution flag and deadline, allowing stakeholders to create proposals, cast votes and finalise outcomes after review【F:smart-contracts/solidity/DaoGovernance.sol†L4-L40】. A Rust/Wasm implementation mirrors these semantics for chains that favour WebAssembly runtimes, exposing the same creation, voting and execution interfaces for cross-platform parity【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/dao_governance.rs†L1-L44】.

## Timed Governance
Each proposal carries an explicit expiry. When a proposal is created, the contract sets its deadline to the current block timestamp plus a caller-supplied duration, ensuring votes are accepted only within the authorised window and execution occurs solely after the deadline has elapsed【F:smart-contracts/solidity/DaoGovernance.sol†L7-L32】【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/dao_governance.rs†L5-L37】. This timing model prevents stale decisions from re-entering deliberation and enforces responsive governance cycles suited to enterprise change-control standards.

## Security and Auditability
- **Audit Logging** – append‑only logs capture governance events for forensic review and compliance reporting【F:internal/governance/audit_log.go†L5-L28】.
- **Replay Protection** – a replay protector tracks previously processed identifiers, blocking duplicate or malicious transactions from re‑entering the system【F:internal/governance/replay_protection.go†L5-L24】.
- **Test Coverage** – unit tests validate that log entries persist and that replay identifiers cannot be reused, reinforcing operational reliability【F:internal/governance/audit_log_test.go†L5-L10】【F:internal/governance/replay_protection_test.go†L5-L12】.

These modules ensure governance actions remain traceable and resistant to tampering across distributed environments.

## Full Blockchain Governance
Governance spans the entire Synnergy stack. Authority nodes gatekeep policy changes, token-ledger balances and staking totals define voting weight, and smart-contract deadlines codify timeliness. CLI utilities and integration scripts wire these layers together so proposals flow from submission to audit logging without manual intervention, allowing Blackridge Group Ltd. to present a cohesive, end-to-end governance experience for regulators, enterprises and community stakeholders alike.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network governance framework couples programmable on‑chain logic with disciplined oversight. Through modular tokens, auditable services and secure tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a governance model that balances community participation with institutional accountability, positioning the platform for sustainable, transparent evolution.

## High availability

# High Availability

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network is engineered to deliver continuous service even under adverse conditions. High availability is achieved through a combination of distributed architecture, automated failover, proactive monitoring, and operational best practices that keep mission‑critical services online.

## Architectural Principles for Resilience
- **Distributed ledger replication** ensures every authority node maintains a full copy of the blockchain, eliminating single points of failure and enabling rapid recovery.
- **Geographically diverse deployment** spreads nodes across availability zones and regions, reducing the impact of localized outages.
- **Stateless node design** allows quick provisioning or replacement of nodes without complex recovery procedures.

## Automated Failover Management
Synnergy incorporates a heartbeat‑driven failover controller that tracks active nodes and promotes backups when the primary becomes unresponsive. The `FailoverManager` records the last heartbeat of each node and elects the most recent backup as the new primary if the current leader exceeds its timeout window【F:core/high_availability.go†L8-L69】. This automated promotion minimizes service interruption and removes the need for manual intervention during node failures.

## Command Line Orchestration
Operators can manage high availability directly from the Synnergy CLI. The `highavailability` command suite initializes the failover manager, registers backup nodes, records heartbeats, and reports the active primary node, enabling seamless integration with scripts and orchestration tools【F:cli/high_availability.go†L15-L73】.

## Health Monitoring and Telemetry
To sustain availability over time, nodes expose runtime metrics through the `SystemHealthLogger`. This component captures CPU usage, memory allocation, peer counts, and block height, storing the latest snapshot for downstream monitoring services and the Watchtower node network【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】. Continuous telemetry empowers operators to detect anomalies early and trigger preventative maintenance before they impact uptime.

## Watchtower Oversight and Network Security
Dedicated Watchtower nodes survey the chain for integrity issues while enforcing ingress rules through an embedded firewall. Each watchtower periodically collects health metrics and reports detected forks, giving operators a real‑time view of node performance and potential consensus divergences【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L67】. Its lightweight `Firewall` blocks malicious addresses, tokens, or IPs, preserving bandwidth and shielding critical services from denial‑of‑service attacks【F:firewall.go†L5-L90】.

## Data Replication and Query Layer
High availability extends beyond consensus to content and query distribution. `ContentNetworkNode` instances register the assets they host so peers can quickly discover alternate sources when a node becomes unreachable【F:content_node.go†L5-L48】. For read‑heavy workloads, `IndexingNode` maintains in‑memory key/value indexes that serve low‑latency queries without stressing primary ledger services【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L56】.

## Anomaly Detection and Predictive Maintenance
Proactive analytics complement raw telemetry. The streaming `AnomalyDetector` calculates rolling mean and variance scores, flagging outliers that may foreshadow resource exhaustion or attack patterns before service is disrupted【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】. Integrating these insights with Watchtower alerts enables automated remediation workflows and escalation policies suitable for enterprise SLAs.

## Resilience Testing
High availability logic is validated through unit tests that simulate node failures. `TestFailoverManager` forces a primary node to miss heartbeats and verifies that backups seamlessly assume leadership, ensuring the promotion algorithm works under adverse conditions【F:high_availability_test.go†L8-L21】. These tests provide a baseline for more advanced chaos engineering drills in production.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Strategy
Rolling upgrades keep the network secure without disrupting service. Administrators can introduce backup nodes, allow them to sync, and then gracefully drain traffic from primaries during maintenance windows. Combined with the failover manager, this strategy maintains quorum while applying patches or configuration changes.

## Operational Best Practices
- Deploy multiple authority and watchtower nodes per region to absorb infrastructure failures.
- Use diverse cloud providers or on‑premise data centers to avoid correlated outages.
- Automate heartbeat emission and health checks through the CLI or orchestration platform.
- Regularly review telemetry dashboards and alerting rules to validate system health.
- Periodically execute failover and disaster‑recovery drills to validate runbooks and tooling.
- Incorporate anomaly thresholds into alerting pipelines so operators can intervene before SLAs are breached.

## Conclusion
Through deliberate architecture and automated operations, Blackridge Group Ltd. ensures the Synnergy Network remains resilient, self‑healing, and available around the clock. High availability is not a single feature but an ecosystem of practices that safeguard the continuity of decentralized services.

## How apply for a grant or loan from loanpool

# How to Apply for a Grant or Loan from the LoanPool

## 1. Overview
The LoanPool is Blackridge Group Ltd's on-chain credit facility for the Synnergy Network. It allows our community to propose, review and disburse grants or loans from a shared treasury in a transparent and auditable manner. Two complementary flows exist:

- **Proposals** – Authority nodes or authorised users submit proposals to direct treasury funds to a recipient. These can represent grants or structured loans.
- **Applications** – Individual users submit personal loan requests that are voted on before disbursement.

Both flows rely on the same underlying treasury and governance controls, ensuring funds are allocated fairly and within available balances.

## 2. Eligibility and Preparation
Before applying, ensure that you:

1. Hold a verified **SYN900 identity token**, registered through the IdentityService, and have completed all KYC/AML checks.
2. Possess a Synnergy wallet with any required collateral and have enabled multi-factor authentication.
3. Have gathered supporting documentation describing the purpose of the grant or loan, repayment expectations, and projected impact.
4. Understand whether your request is a **grant** (no repayment) or a **loan** (with repayment terms). This distinction is provided in the `type` field when submitting a proposal.
5. Ensure your identity verification logs remain up to date for audit and regulatory review.

## 3. Submitting a Proposal (Grants or Directed Loans)
Authority nodes and approved contributors submit proposals using the `loanpool` CLI module:

```bash
synnergy loanpool submit [creator] [recipient] [type] [amount] [description]
```

- **creator** – wallet address submitting the proposal.
- **recipient** – address that will receive funds if approved.
- **type** – `grant`, `loan`, or other categories accepted by your governance policy.
- **amount** – denomination in smallest unit of the treasury currency.
- **description** – human‑readable justification for the request.
- Proposals remain open for a 24‑hour voting window by default; use `loanpool extend [creator] [id] [hrs]` to add time or `loanpool cancel [creator] [id]` to withdraw the request.

A helper script (`cmd/scripts/loanpool_apply.sh`) wraps this command and provides sensible defaults. After submission, participants can cast votes:

```bash
synnergy loanpool vote [voter] [id]
```

Each proposal accrues votes until the deadline, after which the pool can be ticked to evaluate approvals:

```bash
synnergy loanpool tick
```

The `tick` operation scans all pending proposals and marks them approved when at least one vote exists and the deadline has not yet passed.

Approved proposals are disbursed from treasury if sufficient balance remains:

```bash
synnergy loanpool disburse [id]
```

Disbursements draw from the shared treasury and will error if insufficient funds remain.

## 4. Submitting a Personal Loan Application
Individuals request financing directly through the `loanpool_apply` module, which manages loan applications on top of the same treasury:

```bash
synnergy loanpool_apply submit [applicant] [amount] [termMonths] [purpose]
```

- **applicant** – verified user ID.
- **amount** – requested funds.
- **termMonths** – repayment duration in months.
- **purpose** – reason for the loan.

Community members vote with:

```bash
synnergy loanpool_apply vote [voter] [id]
```

An administrator or scheduled process finalises approvals:

```bash
synnergy loanpool_apply process
```

During processing, any application with at least one recorded vote is marked as approved.

Once approved, funds are released to the applicant:

```bash
synnergy loanpool_apply disburse [id]
```

## 5. Loan and Grant Programme Types
The LoanPool supports branded funding instruments tailored for distinct use cases:

- **Repayable proposals** – capital-intensive projects are submitted as `LoanProposal` records and must reach community quorum before disbursement.
- **Micro-loans** – streamlined retail requests flow through `LoanPoolApply`, where a single affirmative vote is sufficient for approval【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L33-L64】.
- **Non-repayable grants** – the SYN3800 registry records each grant with a beneficiary and named category, enabling programme-level accounting【F:core/syn3800.go†L8-L37】. Tests illustrate a canonical `research` grant example【F:core/syn3800_test.go†L5-L8】.

Named smart-contract templates provide additional loan flavours:

- **CollateralizedLoan** – secures borrowing against pledged assets before funds release【F:smart-contracts/solidity/CollateralizedLoan.sol†L4-L5】.
- **UndercollateralizedLoan** – allows credit-based lending with reduced collateral requirements【F:smart-contracts/solidity/UndercollateralizedLoan.sol†L4-L5】.
- **StableRateLoan** – fixes interest charges for predictable repayment schedules【F:smart-contracts/solidity/StableRateLoan.sol†L4-L5】.
- **VariableRateLoan** – adjusts interest dynamically to governance or oracle benchmarks【F:smart-contracts/solidity/VariableRateLoan.sol†L4-L5】.
- **FlashLoan** – enables uncollateralised borrowing within a single transaction cycle【F:smart-contracts/solidity/FlashLoan.sol†L4-L5】.
- **LoanAuction** – framework for market-driven rate discovery among competing lenders【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanAuction.sol†L4-L5】.
- **LoanFactory** and **LoanRegistry** – scaffolds for deploying standardised loans and cataloguing active positions【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanFactory.sol†L4-L5】【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanRegistry.sol†L4-L5】.

Grant programmes are likewise extensible:

- **GrantTracker** – foundation for tracking grant milestones and spending【F:smart-contracts/solidity/GrantTracker.sol†L3-L5】.
- **GrantMatching** – pairs community donations with approved proposals for matched-fund campaigns【F:smart-contracts/solidity/GrantMatching.sol†L4-L5】.
- **ScholarshipFund** – dedicated channel for education-oriented grants and scholarships【F:smart-contracts/solidity/ScholarshipFund.sol†L4-L5】.

## 6. Authority Oversight and Distribution
Disbursement authority is restricted to vetted governance participants:

- The **AuthorityNodeRegistry** registers nodes and tracks votes, exposing membership checks through `IsAuthorityNode`【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L34-L55】【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L98-L103】.
- The virtual machine provides a `Loanpool_IsAuthority` opcode so contracts and CLIs can verify that the caller is a registered authority before releasing funds【F:core/opcode.go†L603-L610】.
- Authority nodes are managed through the `synnergy authority` CLI, which supports registration, voting and electorate sampling for due diligence【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L15-L48】.

Only nodes passing these checks may invoke `loanpool disburse` or `loanpool_apply disburse`, ensuring that loan and grant distribution remains under explicit Blackridge Group Ltd oversight.

## 7. Tracking and Management
Both proposals and applications can be inspected and listed for auditability:

```bash
synnergy loanpool get [id]
synnergy loanpool list
synnergy loanpool_apply get [id]
synnergy loanpool_apply list
```

Lifecycle adjustments for proposals are also available:

```bash
synnergy loanpool cancel [creator] [id]
synnergy loanpool extend [creator] [id] [hrs]
```

Administrative operators at Blackridge Group Ltd can pause new submissions or review treasury statistics through the `loanmgr` commands:

```bash
synnergy loanmgr pause
synnergy loanmgr resume
synnergy loanmgr stats
```

These controls interact with the underlying `LoanPool` manager, which reports `Treasury`, `ProposalCount`, `ApprovedCount` and `DisbursedCount` metrics.

## 8. Enterprise Integration and Automation
Structured outputs make the LoanPool suitable for enterprise monitoring and automation:

- `loanpool` and `loanpool_apply` `get`/`list` commands return JSON `LoanProposalView` and `LoanApplicationView` records, enabling dashboards and compliance archives.
- `loanmgr stats` surfaces aggregate treasury data for capacity planning.
- Machine‑readable responses allow orchestration tools to trigger disbursements or workflow steps programmatically.

## 9. Compliance and Security
Blackridge Group Ltd enforces strict security around LoanPool operations:

- **Identity verification** – All participants must authenticate via SYN900 tokens with KYC/AML compliance, with verification methods logged for audit.
- **Multi‑factor authentication** – Sensitive actions require multiple verification factors, including optional biometric checks.
- **AI‑driven monitoring** – Machine‑learning models scan for voting anomalies and fraudulent submissions, alerting operators to suspicious behaviour.
- **Immutable records** – Every proposal, vote and disbursement is recorded on-chain for full audit trails.

## 10. Best Practices
- Provide concise and complete descriptions to speed up review.
- Monitor deadlines to ensure proposals receive sufficient votes before expiry.
- For loans, maintain repayment discipline to remain eligible for future financing.
- Use the `get` and `list` commands regularly to track status and maintain transparency with stakeholders.
- Review `loanmgr stats` periodically and cancel or extend proposals proactively when circumstances evolve.

## 11. Support
For additional assistance or to escalate issues, contact the Blackridge Group Ltd support team through your authority node representative or the official Synnergy Network communication channels.

By following these steps and aligning with our compliance standards, applicants can seamlessly access grants or loans from the LoanPool while contributing to the health and growth of the Synnergy ecosystem.

## How to apply to charity pool

# Applying to the Synnergy Charity Pool

_Official guidance prepared by **Blackridge Group Ltd**_

## Overview
The Synnergy Charity Pool is an on‑chain treasury that channels a portion of network fees and voluntary donations toward registered philanthropic initiatives. Charities register with the pool, receive votes from the community, and, at the close of each funding cycle, top‑voted organisations become eligible for disbursements. All interactions—registrations, deposits, votes, and payouts—are immutably recorded on the ledger for full transparency.

## Funding Sources and Fee Allocation
The pool is capitalised through two mechanisms:

- **Protocol Fees** – Five percent of every transaction fee is routed into the external charity pool while a separate five percent supports Blackridge Group Ltd’s internal charitable programmes【F:core/fees.go†L115-L123】. These allocations are enforced by the network’s `DistributeFees` policy, ensuring predictable funding regardless of market activity.
- **Voluntary Donations** – Community members or corporate sponsors may augment the pool by depositing additional tokens to the `charity_pool` account, increasing the resources available for distribution.

All funds destined for external causes accumulate under the ledger address `charity_pool`, distinct from `internal_charity` which holds Blackridge‑directed initiatives【F:core/charity.go†L66-L69】.

### Transaction Fee Distribution Model
To provide full transparency to network participants, the Synnergy protocol publishes the complete breakdown of how each transaction fee is allocated:

| Allocation Target | Percentage |
|-------------------|-----------:|
| Internal Development | 5% |
| **Internal Charity (Blackridge programmes)** | **5%** |
| **External Charity Pool** | **5%** |
| Loan Pool | 5% |
| Passive Income Dividend | 5% |
| Validators & Miners | 64% |
| Authority Nodes | 5% |
| Node Hosts | 5% |
| Creator Wallet | 1% |

These values are hard‑coded in the `DistributeFees` routine, guaranteeing that charity allocations remain proportionate regardless of fee volume【F:core/fees.go†L115-L127】.

## Eligibility and Preparation
Before submitting an application, prospective charities should ensure the following:

- **Blockchain Address** – Each charity must control a Synnergy‑compatible wallet capable of receiving token transfers.
- **Clear Mission Category** – Applicants select one of the predefined mission classes such as _HungerRelief_, _ChildrenHelp_, _WildlifeHelp_, _SeaSupport_, _DisasterSupport_, or _WarSupport_ when registering【F:core/charity.go†L12-L22】.
- **Organisation Details** – A human‑readable name and concise description of activities help voters understand the cause.
- **Compliance** – Charities should be legally registered within their jurisdictions and prepared to provide any documentation requested by Blackridge Group Ltd during due diligence.

## Step‑by‑Step Application Process
1. **Prepare a Wallet**  
   Generate or designate a secure wallet address that will act as the charity’s on‑chain identity. This address must remain under the organisation’s control throughout participation.

2. **Gather Registration Data**  
   Compile the charity’s name, chosen mission category, and wallet address. The category determines how the cause is classified in the pool and is stored alongside the registration metadata for auditing purposes【F:core/charity.go†L43-L50】【F:core/charity.go†L90-L100】.

3. **Submit the Registration**  
   Use the Synnergy CLI or an integrated application to transmit the registration:
   ```bash
   synnergy charity_pool register <charity_address> <category_id> "<organisation_name>"
   ```
   - `category_id` corresponds to one of the numeric identifiers in the mission table above.  
   - Upon success, the ledger records the registration under the key `charity:reg:<address>`.

4. **Confirm Ledger Entry**
   After submission, query the registration to verify it was persisted:
   ```bash
   synnergy charity_pool --json registration <charity_address>
   ```
   The response returns the stored metadata, including the selected category and initial vote count.

5. **Renew for Subsequent Cycles**
   Registrations are tied to funding cycles. To remain eligible for future distributions, charities should resubmit or update their registration before each new cycle begins. The `Cycle` field in the registration record facilitates historical auditing and ensures votes apply to the correct period【F:core/charity.go†L43-L50】.

## Community Voting and Evaluation
- **Eligible Voters** – Only holders of SYN900 identity tokens may vote, ensuring that each community member can support a single charity per cycle【F:core/charity.go†L103-L110】.
- **Casting Votes**  
  ```bash
  synnergy charity_pool vote <voter_address> <charity_address>
  ```
  Votes are written to the ledger for auditability and will be tallied when funding decisions are made.
- **Cycle Timing** – The pool operates in discrete cycles beginning from network genesis. Administrators may trigger a maintenance tick to process end‑of‑cycle logic.

## Capacity, Cycle Timing, and Deadlines
The external charity allocation derives from cumulative protocol fees and voluntary contributions, so the amount available each cycle varies with network activity. Unused funds roll over to subsequent cycles, preserving long‑term capacity.

Each cycle includes a **registration window**, a **voting window**, and a **settlement window**:

- **Registration Window** – Charities must submit or renew their registration before this window closes. Late submissions are automatically deferred to the following cycle.
- **Voting Window** – Verified community members cast their votes. Real‑time totals can be audited from the ledger to help organisations gauge support.
- **Settlement Window** – After voting ends, administrators tally results and prepare disbursements. Funds not awarded remain in the pool for future rounds.

Blackridge Group Ltd publishes the official calendar, including cycle start and end dates, on our governance portal. Organisations planning major campaigns should file registrations at least one full cycle in advance to guarantee eligibility.

## Funding, Donations, and Disbursement
- **Donations** – Anyone can contribute to the pool by depositing tokens, which increases the pool balance available for future distribution【F:core/charity.go†L76-L87】.
- **Payouts** – At the conclusion of each cycle, top‑voted charities may receive allocations from the pool. The reference implementation currently stores votes and registrations while leaving automated payout logic for future development【F:core/charity.go†L116-L123】.
- **Withdrawal of Internal Funds** – Blackridge Group Ltd maintains an internal charity account for corporate initiatives; withdrawals from this account are managed separately from community‑directed funds【F:core/charity.go†L66-L69】.

### Auditing and Balance Queries
Administrators and auditors can verify pool holdings at any time using the management CLI:

```bash
synnergy charity_mgmt balances --json
```

The command returns the current token balances for the community pool and the internal charity account, enabling transparent reconciliation【F:cli/charity.go†L206-L218】.

## Ongoing Responsibilities
- **Transparency** – Successful applicants are expected to publish periodic impact reports so token holders can verify how funds were used.
- **Key Management** – Safeguard private keys controlling the registered address. Compromised addresses cannot be recovered by the network.
- **Governance Participation** – Charities are encouraged to engage with the Synnergy governance process, providing feedback on pool operations and category definitions.

## Enterprise Integration and Compliance
Larger organisations can integrate directly with the Synnergy Network through our APIs and enterprise SDKs. Ledger interactions such as registration, voting, donation tracking, and balance queries can be automated within existing back‑office systems, enabling near real‑time reconciliation and audit trails. Event webhooks and batch export endpoints are provided for enterprise resource‑planning platforms that require periodic snapshots.

Blackridge Group Ltd conducts due diligence on all applicants and may request supplemental documentation to satisfy regulatory obligations or anti‑money‑laundering controls. Dedicated compliance contacts are available to help multinational charities align their internal policies with on‑chain transparency requirements.

## Support
For assistance with registration or technical integration, contact the Blackridge Group Ltd support team via our official channels. Development proposals and enhancements to the charity module are welcomed through our public repository.

*Blackridge Group Ltd remains committed to leveraging the Synnergy Network for transparent, community‑driven philanthropy.*

## How to be secure

# How to Be Secure

As part of the Synnergy network, **Blackridge Group Ltd.** is committed to delivering
an environment where contributors, validators and users can operate with
confidence. The platform’s design embraces a defence‑in‑depth strategy that
combines rigorous identity checks, encrypted communications, continuous
monitoring and strict governance. This section outlines the architectural
components and operational practices that keep Synnergy secure.

## Security Philosophy
- **Zero trust** – Every request is authenticated and authorised; nothing inside
  the network is implicitly trusted.
- **Layered defence** – Multiple safeguards (biometrics, role checks, firewalls,
  anomaly monitors) overlap so a single failure does not expose the system.
- **Auditability** – All sensitive operations emit verifiable logs that can be
  inspected by regulators and stakeholders.

## Identity and Access Management
### Biometric Verification
Nodes can require biometric signatures before executing privileged actions. The
`BiometricSecurityNode` couples an identifier with a biometric authenticator and
runs functions only after successful verification, returning errors when checks
fail【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L50】. Biometric templates are stored as SHA‑256
hashes and validated using ECDSA signatures, preventing replay or template theft
【F:biometrics_auth.go†L25-L45】.

### Role‑Based Access Control
Fine‑grained permissions are enforced with the `AccessController`, which grants
or revokes named roles for specific addresses and verifies membership during
runtime checks【F:access_control.go†L5-L48】.

### Identity Verification and Audit Trails
The `IdentityService` registers personal details for on‑ledger addresses and
records each verification method with timestamps, providing a persistent audit
trail for compliance teams【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L75】.

### ID Wallet Registration
Wallets can be bound to identity metadata via the `IDRegistry`, ensuring that
only registered wallets participate in sensitive workflows. Registration checks
prevent duplicates and expose helper methods to query registration status or
retrieve associated information【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L43】.

## Data Protection
### Secure Storage
Sensitive model or configuration data can be encrypted at rest through
`SecureStorage`. It seals payloads with AES‑GCM and a mandatory 32‑byte key,
ensuring confidentiality and integrity before the bytes reach disk【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L23-L75】.

### Zero‑Trust Data Channels
Real‑time communications traverse `ZeroTrustEngine` channels. Each channel holds
its own symmetric key and Ed25519 key pair; messages are encrypted, signed and
verified before delivery to prevent tampering or impersonation【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L114】.

### Private Transactions
Transactions requiring confidentiality are wrapped by the `PrivateTxManager`.
Payloads are encrypted with AES‑GCM and stored alongside their nonces so only
holders of the original key can decrypt them【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L79】.

## AI Model Integrity
To secure machine‑learning components, the `DriftMonitor` tracks baseline
metrics for each model hash and flags deviations that exceed configurable
thresholds. This protects automated decision systems from silent model drift
that could otherwise be exploited【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.

## Network and Node Hardening
### Firewall Enforcement
Every node ships with a lightweight `Firewall` that blocks malicious wallet
addresses, token identifiers or peer IPs through thread‑safe blocklists
【F:firewall.go†L5-L104】.

### Sandbox Execution for Smart Contracts
The `SandboxManager` isolates contract execution into dedicated sandboxes with
gas and memory limits, and supports start, stop, reset and deletion operations to
contain faulty or hostile contracts【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

### Virtual Machine Execution Controls
The `SimpleVM` interpreter enforces concurrency limits and per‑opcode gas usage,
rejecting execution when capacity is saturated or gas limits are exceeded. Unknown
opcodes fall back to a no‑op handler to maintain deterministic behaviour
【F:virtual_machine.go†L27-L156】.

### Resource Metering and Gas Accounting
To prevent denial‑of‑service through expensive opcodes, the `GasTable` assigns
explicit costs to every supported operation and caches them for fast lookup. The
table is populated from a reference manifest and exposes helpers to register
additional opcodes or query existing ones, ensuring predictable fees across
network upgrades【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】.

### Watchtower Monitoring and System Health Logging
`WatchtowerNode` instances observe the network, collect runtime metrics and report
forks while exposing an embedded firewall for quick remediation【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L95】.
Underlying metrics are provided by `SystemHealthLogger`, which records CPU usage,
memory allocation, peer counts and block heights for diagnostics【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】.

### Cross‑Chain Bridge Security
The `BridgeTransferManager` hashes transfer parameters into unique identifiers
and stores claims with proofs, preventing double spends and providing traceable
records for each cross‑chain deposit and withdrawal【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L10-L49】【F:cross_chain_bridge.go†L52-L66】.

## Behavioural Monitoring and Governance
### Anomaly Detection
A lightweight `AnomalyDetector` continuously updates statistical baselines and
flags outliers using z‑score thresholds, enabling early detection of suspicious
activity【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

### Compliance and Fraud Monitoring
The `ComplianceService` verifies KYC commitments, records fraud signals with
risk scores and maintains auditable trails for every address. Coupled with the
`ComplianceManager`, transactions involving suspended accounts are rejected
unless explicitly whitelisted【F:compliance.go†L61-L124】【F:compliance_management.go†L8-L78】.

### Stake Penalties
Validator accountability is enforced through the `StakePenaltyManager`, which
adjusts stake levels and records penalty histories whenever misbehaviour is
observed【F:stake_penalty.go†L16-L58】.

### Regulatory Oversight
`RegulatoryManager` keeps a registry of jurisdictional rules and evaluates
transactions for violations, while `RegulatoryNode` instances flag offending
addresses to satisfy compliance requirements【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L49】.

### Dynamic Consensus Adaptation
For resilience against targeted attacks or shifting network conditions, the
`ConsensusHopper` evaluates live metrics such as throughput, latency and active
validator counts to switch between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake and
proof‑of‑history modes, keeping block production stable under diverse loads
【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L5-L71】.

## Operational Resilience and Recovery
### High Availability
`FailoverManager` monitors node heartbeats and automatically promotes the most
recently responsive backup when a primary node becomes unresponsive. This
ensures continued service during outages without manual intervention
【F:high_availability.go†L8-L70】.

### Incident Response
Documented runbooks should define escalation paths for suspected breaches. Logs
from watchtowers, compliance services and system health monitors provide the
forensic evidence needed to triage incidents and restore services rapidly.

## Operational Best Practices
- Keep node and wallet software updated to inherit the latest security patches.
- Rotate keys and biometric data periodically, revoking obsolete credentials.
- Review watchtower metrics and anomaly reports to respond to irregularities
  promptly.
- Use firewalls and sandbox controls to restrict untrusted peers and contracts.
- Maintain off‑chain backups of critical keys and configuration data in secure
  locations.
- Validate KYC documents and review compliance risk scores before engaging with
  new counterparties.
- Test failover procedures and restore processes regularly to guarantee recovery
  objectives.
- Keep incident response playbooks up to date and rehearse them with operations
  teams.

## Conclusion
Security within the Synnergy ecosystem is not a single feature but a
comprehensive framework aligned with the standards of **Blackridge Group Ltd.**
By combining robust cryptography, continuous monitoring and strong governance,
Synnergy equips participants with the tools needed to operate safely in a
hostile digital landscape.

## How to become an authority node

# How to Become an Authority Node

Becoming an authority node in the Synnergy Network is a formal on‑chain
process designed to preserve the integrity, security and continuity of the
ecosystem.  This guide from **Blackridge Group Ltd** explains the
prerequisites, application workflow and ongoing expectations for
participants who wish to obtain and maintain authority status.

## 1. Role of Authority Nodes

Authority nodes are trusted entities that participate in governance
activities, manage critical services and help steer protocol evolution.  In
code, an authority node is defined by its address, role and recorded votes
from the community, all stored in an indexed registry that enables rapid
lookups and election sampling【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L11-L80】.

At scale, this registry leverages a concurrent in‑memory index that stores
addresses, roles and vote maps, allowing constant‑time queries even in large
networks【F:internal/nodes/authority_nodes/index.go†L12-L56】. Operators interact
with the registry through the `authority` CLI, which exposes commands for
registration, voting, electorate sampling and deregistration【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L15-L112】.

### Specialised Variants

The platform recognises specialised authority implementations, such as:

* **Elected Authority Nodes** – nodes granted authority for a fixed term,
  after which their status expires unless re‑elected【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L17】.
* **Government Authority Nodes** – regulator‑operated nodes that cannot
  mint coins or alter monetary policy, preserving the network's fixed supply
  guarantees【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L1-L24】.

## 2. Prerequisites

Prospective operators should prepare the following before applying:

1. **Wallet & Address** – generate and secure a Synnergy wallet address with
   sufficient funds for staking and operational costs.
2. **Infrastructure** – provision reliable compute, storage and network
   resources.  The `network.yaml` configuration illustrates typical port and
   peer settings used in production deployments【F:configs/network.yaml†L1-L38】.
3. **Synnergy CLI** – install the `synnergy` command‑line interface or build
   it from source using the project’s tooling.
4. **Identity & KYC** – register operator information through the built‑in
   identity service and record a hashed KYC commitment so that governance
   actions can be audited【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】【F:compliance.go†L12-L70】.
5. **Regulatory Policies** – review Blackridge Group’s operational standards
   and confirm that any jurisdiction‑specific regulations are encoded in the
   network’s policy manager before launch【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L38】.

## 3. Application Lifecycle

Authority status is granted through an application and voting process
administered on‑chain via the `AuthorityApplicationManager`【F:core/authority_apply.go†L9-L110】.

### 3.1 Submit an Application

```bash
synnergy authority_apply submit <candidate_address> <role> "<description>"
```

This command creates an application with a defined time‑to‑live.  Each
submission receives a unique identifier that is used for subsequent voting
and finalisation.

### 3.2 Gather Votes

Community members and existing authorities review the proposal and vote:

```bash
synnergy authority_apply vote <voter_address> <application_id> <true|false>
```

Votes can be amended or withdrawn during the application window.  Multiple
approval votes are required to advance a candidate.

### 3.3 Finalise the Application

When the voting period concludes, finalise the outcome:

```bash
synnergy authority_apply finalize <application_id>
```

If approvals exceed rejections, the candidate is registered automatically in
the authority node registry.  Expired or finalised applications are cleaned
up by periodic `tick` operations. The `authority` CLI can then be used to
inspect membership, sample electorates or deregister nodes as required
【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L20-L112】.

### 3.4 Convenience Scripts

For automated environments, the repository provides helper scripts:

* `cmd/scripts/authority_apply.sh` – submits an application with default
  parameters for rapid testing【F:cmd/scripts/authority_apply.sh†L1-L8】.
* `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh` – registers an already approved node in
  the registry using the CLI【F:scripts/authority_node_setup.sh†L1-L12】.

## 4. Post‑Approval Responsibilities

Once registered, authority nodes are expected to:

* Participate actively in governance by reviewing and voting on future
  authority applications and protocol proposals.
* Maintain high availability and security standards, including timely patch
  application and continuous monitoring.
* Operate additional services relevant to their role (e.g., regulatory,
  auditing or cross‑chain oversight).
* Adhere to financial controls; for example, government authority nodes are
  restricted from minting or altering monetary policy by design.

The registry and accompanying CLI commands allow operators to inspect their
status, sample electorates or deregister when necessary.

## 5. Network Configuration

Authority nodes must be listed in the network configuration so peers can
identify them.  Each entry specifies the node’s identifier, type and public
address as seen in the sample configuration file【F:configs/network.yaml†L42-L52】.
Genesis files may also allocate initial balances or stakes to authority
addresses to bootstrap participation【F:configs/genesis.json†L5-L32】.

## 6. Security and Compliance

Authority nodes are bound by strict auditability requirements:

* **Identity Service** – stores operator metadata and verification logs so
  that actions can be traced back to a real‑world entity【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L58】.
* **Compliance Service** – records hashed KYC commitments, risk scores and
  audit entries, enabling transparent oversight of node behaviour【F:compliance.go†L12-L70】.
* **Regulatory Manager** – encodes jurisdictional policies that transactions
  must satisfy; regulatory nodes can flag or reject non‑compliant activity
  based on these rules【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L38】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L33】.

## 7. Operational Tooling

Enterprise operators often automate routine tasks:

* **System Health Logging** – the `SystemHealthLogger` gathers runtime metrics
  for dashboards and alerting【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】.
* **Failover Management** – `FailoverManager` promotes standby nodes when the
  primary becomes unresponsive, supporting seamless upgrades and recovery
  processes【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.
* **Dashboards** – the web control panel exposes an `/authority` page that
  lists registered nodes via the CLI, while the Authority Node Index GUI
  offers a TypeScript foundation for rich enterprise interfaces【F:web/README.md†L33-L35】【F:web/pages/authority.js†L1-L30】【F:GUI/authority-node-index/README.md†L1-L33】.

## 8. Best Practices

* **Security Hardening** – isolate keys, enable firewalls and monitor logs.
* **Observability** – use the system health logging utilities to capture
  metrics and detect anomalies【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】.
* **High Availability** – configure failover managers to keep authority
  services online during maintenance or outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.
* **Regular Upgrades** – track releases from Blackridge Group Ltd and apply
  upgrades in a staged manner to minimise downtime.
* **Community Engagement** – remain responsive to governance discussions and
  contribute to ecosystem documentation and tooling.

Synnergy Network’s vision.

## How to connect to a node

# How to Connect to a Node

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd provides the Synnergy network as a modular, enterprise-grade blockchain. Connecting to a node allows developers and operators to participate in consensus, broadcast transactions, and monitor the system. This guide walks through prerequisites, configuration, secure connection procedures, and diagnostics.

## Prerequisites
- **Source build**: compile the `synnergy` client using Go 1.24 or later.
- **Configuration file**: a YAML file describing network identifiers, peer limits, and listening ports.
- **Network access**: ability to reach peer addresses over the configured P2P port.
- **Security credentials**: user identifiers and biometrics when broadcasting transactions.
- **Hardware resources**: at least 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of RAM, and persistent storage for the blockchain database.
- **Firewall rules**: inbound access to the configured P2P port and outbound egress to known peers.

## Configure Network Parameters
Create or edit a configuration file to define the target network. Key fields include the network identifier, chain ID, maximum peers, and transport settings【F:configs/network.yaml†L1-L10】. Example:

```yaml
network:
  id: synnergy-mainnet
  chain_id: 1215
  max_peers: 50
  p2p_port: 30303
  bootstrap_peers: []
```

Set the `SYN_CONFIG` environment variable to point to this file before launching the client.

## Advanced Configuration
Beyond basic network identifiers, the configuration file controls consensus, virtual machine limits, storage paths, and logging options【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L40】. Adjust these fields to align with enterprise policies:

- **Consensus** – select algorithm and weighting and tune block times for throughput.
- **RPC exposure** – toggle the JSON‑RPC interface for remote management.
- **Listen address** – bind to specific interfaces for multi‑homed servers.
- **Storage and logging** – choose data directories and log verbosity for audit retention.

## Starting Local Services
Start the networking stack and inspect connectivity using the CLI【F:README.md†L110-L117】:

```bash
export SYN_CONFIG=configs/dev.yaml
./synnergy network start   # launch networking stack
./synnergy network peers   # list currently known peers
```

Stop services with `./synnergy network stop` when finished.

## High Availability and Failover
Production deployments should avoid single points of failure. The `FailoverManager` monitors node heartbeats and promotes the most recent backup if the primary becomes unresponsive【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】. Deploy at least one standby instance and send regular heartbeats to maintain readiness.

## Dialing a Seed Node
To join an existing mesh, run the base node module and dial a seed peer. The module exposes lifecycle and peer management commands【F:cli/base_node.go†L14-L56】:

```bash
./synnergy basenode start
./synnergy basenode dial <seed-address>
./synnergy basenode peers
```

After the seed handshake completes, the node populates its peer table and begins syncing.

## Peer Discovery and Management
Peer discovery is handled by the `peer` command set built on the `PeerManager` structure【F:cli/peer_management.go†L1-L44】【F:core/peer_management.go†L21-L60】. Each subcommand reports its gas cost and honors the global `--json` flag for machine‑readable responses. Typical workflow:

```bash
./synnergy peer connect <addr> --json      # record a peer by address
./synnergy peer advertise <topic> --json   # announce presence on a topic
./synnergy peer discover <topic> --json    # list peers advertising the topic
```

Connections are pooled and reused through `ConnectionPool`, which dials network endpoints, tracks capacity and releases connections back to the pool when finished【F:core/connection_pool.go†L33-L76】.

## Firewall and Access Controls
Synnergy includes a built‑in `Firewall` to block malicious wallets, tokens, or IP addresses【F:firewall.go†L5-L44】. Maintain allow and deny lists that mirror corporate security policies, and export rules for compliance reviews.

## Publishing and Subscribing
Use the `network` module to publish messages or subscribe to topics across the peer mesh【F:cli/network.go†L41-L80】:

```bash
./synnergy network broadcast blocks "payload"  # publish data
./synnergy network subscribe blocks             # stream messages until Ctrl-C
```

## Secure Data Channels
For confidential workloads, open encrypted channels through the `ZeroTrustEngine`, which generates per‑channel keys and signs every payload【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L66】. Messages can later be verified and decrypted by authorised recipients.

## Security and Authentication
Before a transaction is propagated, the network verifies biometric signatures and attaches them to the payload for accountability. This requirement is enforced by the `Network` service when broadcasting transactions【F:core/network.go†L104-L113】. Operators may also wrap privileged routines with `BiometricSecurityNode` to enforce biometric checks around sensitive actions【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L47】.

## Cross-Chain Connectivity
When bridging to external ledgers, manage links with the `ConnectionManager`, which tracks active and historic cross‑chain sessions【F:cross_chain_connection.go†L10-L58】. Connections can be opened, listed, and safely closed as business requirements evolve.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics
- **Peer list**: `./synnergy network peers`
- **Connection pool stats**: expose metrics by instrumenting `ConnectionPool.Stats()` for active vs. capacity numbers【F:core/connection_pool.go†L112-L125】.
- **System health**: `./synnergy system_health snapshot` captures runtime metrics via the `SystemHealthLogger` and can be automated through a `WatchtowerNode` for continuous monitoring【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L40】【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L68】.

## Troubleshooting
- **No peers discovered**: verify `bootstrap_peers` and network reachability. Use `peer connect` to add known addresses manually.
- **Pool exhausted**: increase the `max_peers` setting or call `ConnectionPool.Release`/`Close` to free resources.
- **Biometric errors**: confirm the correct user ID and signature payloads are supplied with each broadcast.
- **Failover not triggered**: ensure backups send regular heartbeats and that the timeout window reflects operational SLAs.
- **Firewall blocks legitimate traffic**: review and adjust address and IP allow lists.

## How to create a node

# How to Create a Node

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to be a modular, secure, and sustainable blockchain platform. Nodes are the operational backbone of this network, processing transactions, safeguarding data, and enabling advanced features like regulatory oversight and energy-aware consensus. This guide explains how to create and deploy a node that aligns with Synnergy’s architecture and governance principles.

## Node Archetypes
Synnergy provides a broad catalog of node implementations so operators can tailor infrastructure to their mission. The main families are outlined below.

### Core Infrastructure
- **Base Node** – provides foundational peer management and lifecycle control, exposing start/stop hooks and seed peer dialing【F:core/base_node.go†L10-L76】.
- **Full Node** – stores the complete chain in archive or pruned modes and validates blocks accordingly【F:core/full_node.go†L5-L38】.
- **Light Node** – maintains only block headers for resource‑constrained devices while still verifying chain continuity【F:core/light_node.go†L5-L31】.
- **Validator Node** – couples a ledger with validator and quorum management to orchestrate staking‑based consensus【F:core/validator_node.go†L5-L48】.
- **Gateway Node** – bridges external data sources through custom endpoints configurable at runtime【F:core/gateway_node.go†L9-L55】.
- **Consensus‑Specific Node** – locks the consensus engine to Proof‑of‑Work, Proof‑of‑Stake, or Proof‑of‑History modes as required【F:core/consensus_specific_node.go†L1-L30】.
- **Elected Authority Node** – grants authority privileges for a fixed term, automatically expiring at the configured end date【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】.

### Operational and Data Nodes
- **Mining Node** – lightweight PoW miner that submits candidate blocks asynchronously, suitable for simulations or testnets【F:mining_node.go†L12-L76】.
- **Mobile Mining Node** – extends the mining node with battery‑aware throttling to protect mobile hardware【F:mobile_mining_node.go†L8-L44】.
- **Staking Node** – tracks delegated stakes and exposes locking and unlocking primitives without a full ledger dependency【F:staking_node.go†L5-L47】.
- **Indexing Node** – builds in‑memory key/value indexes for accelerated queries and analytics workloads【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L33】.
- **Content Node** – advertises available content items so peers can discover hosted assets across the network【F:content_node.go†L5-L33】.
- **Geospatial Node** – records geospatial coordinates and histories for tracked subjects【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L46】.
- **Environmental Monitoring Node** – evaluates sensor feeds against programmable conditions to trigger on‑chain actions【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L64】.

### Security, Oversight and Governance
- **Watchtower Node** – monitors peers, enforces firewall rules and streams system health metrics for anomaly detection【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L66】.
- **Energy‑Efficient Node** – aggregates power consumption, issues sustainability certificates and throttles when efficiency drops【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L16-L80】.
- **Regulatory Node** – checks transactions against registered rules and logs violations for audit trails【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L43】.
- **Custodial Node** – safekeeps user assets and releases funds back to the ledger with balance checks【F:core/custodial_node.go†L8-L48】.
- **Central Banking Node** – manages CBDC token supply under a declared monetary policy while respecting the fixed SYN cap【F:core/central_banking_node.go†L9-L37】.
- **Government Authority Node** – enforces governance without minting or policy powers, reflecting separation of duties【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.
- **Bank Institutional Node** – registers participating institutions and exposes their presence to the ledger【F:core/bank_institutional_node.go†L1-L43】.
- **Biometric Security Node** – gates privileged operations behind biometric verification routines【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L46】.
- **Audit Node** – couples bootstrap services with an audit manager to capture on‑chain events for compliance reports【F:core/audit_node.go†L8-L37】.
- **Forensic Node** – retains lightweight transaction and network traces for later investigation【F:core/forensic_node.go†L5-L40】.
- **Historical Node** – archives block summaries by height and hash to service long‑term retrieval requests【F:core/historical_node.go†L1-L55】.
- **Warfare Node** – tracks logistics and tactical updates for military assets, safeguarding command execution【F:warfare_node.go†L11-L48】.
- **Holographic Node** – distributes holographic frames for redundancy, enabling advanced data resilience experiments【F:internal/nodes/holographic_node.go†L9-L33】.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating system:** Linux or macOS with administrative access.
- **Dependencies:**
  - [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.20+ for building the node software.
  - Git for source management.
  - Optional: Docker and Kubernetes for containerised deployments.
- **Network:** Ability to open TCP ports 30303 (P2P) and 8080 (RPC) or adjust firewalls accordingly.

## Environment Setup
1. **Install Go and Git.** Ensure `go` is present in your `PATH`.
2. **Clone the repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blackridge-group/Synnergy.v.1.git
   cd Synnergy.v.1
   ```
3. **Build the Synnergy binary.**
   ```bash
   go build -o bin/synnergy ./cmd/synnergy
   ```

## Creating a Node in Go
Instantiate the node type that suits your requirements. The following example creates a mining node with a nominal hash rate and starts it:

```go
package main
import (
    "synnergy"
)
func main() {
    miner := synnergy.NewMiningNode("miner-01", 100.0)
    miner.Start()
    defer miner.Stop()
}
```
The same pattern applies to other node types, using constructors such as `NewStakingNode`, `NewIndexingNode`, or `NewWatchtowerNode`.

## Network Registration via CLI
Use the `synnergy` command‑line interface to register and manage nodes. The authority workflow below illustrates submitting an application and activating the node【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/How to use the CLI.md†L7-L18】:
```bash
synnergy authority_apply submit node1 validator "candidate node"
synnergy authority_apply list --json
synnergy authority register node1 validator
synnergy authority is node1
```
Financial institutions can also register via banking commands before linking their nodes to the network【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/How to use the CLI.md†L14-L18】.

## Configuration and Deployment
For containerised environments, customise the provided Kubernetes manifest. It exposes both peer‑to‑peer and RPC interfaces and mounts a configuration file into the container【F:deploy/k8s/node.yaml†L1-L54】. Apply the manifest with `kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/node.yaml` after adjusting resource limits and environment variables to your infrastructure.

## Security Hardening
Each node embeds a configurable firewall for blocking wallet addresses, token identifiers, or peer IPs, supporting real‑time rule updates without restarting【F:firewall.go†L5-L44】.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
System health metrics—including CPU usage, memory footprint, peer counts, and last block height—are collected through the `SystemHealthLogger` and can be exported to external monitoring stacks【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L41】.

## High Availability and Resilience
The FailoverManager monitors node heartbeats and automatically promotes the most recent backup when the primary becomes unresponsive, minimising downtime for enterprise deployments【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

## Audit, Forensics, and Archival
Audit, Forensic, and Historical nodes extend operational assurance: AuditNode records compliance events, ForensicNode captures transaction and network traces, and HistoricalNode serves archived block data for long‑term analytics【F:core/audit_node.go†L8-L37】【F:core/forensic_node.go†L5-L40】【F:core/historical_node.go†L1-L55】.

## Sustainability and Compliance
Energy‑efficient nodes can issue sustainability certificates and determine when throttling is necessary to maintain efficiency targets【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L52-L75】. For jurisdictions with oversight requirements, regulatory nodes evaluate transactions and log compliance violations for auditability【F:regulatory_node.go†L25-L43】.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, organisations can deploy nodes that integrate seamlessly with the Synnergy Network while meeting operational, environmental, and regulatory expectations. For enterprise support and advanced tooling, contact Blackridge Group Ltd.

## How to create our various tokens

# How to Create Our Various Tokens

Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to support a wide spectrum of tokenised assets, each governed by dedicated registries and ledgers. This guide explains how to instantiate and manage these tokens using the Synnergy libraries and tooling.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Install the Synnergy toolchain** – build the `synnergy` CLI and ensure Go 1.20+ is available.
2. **Set up auxiliary tools** – the `token-creation-tool` GUI scaffolds new token projects and is located under `GUI/token-creation-tool`【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/developer_guide.md†L321-L332】【F:GUI/token-creation-tool/README.md†L1-L23】.
3. **Select the appropriate node role** – some token standards are limited to authority or central bank nodes as described in the developer guide【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/developer_guide.md†L212-L230】.

## 2. General Workflow

1. **Choose a token standard** – review the token categories below and select the structure that matches the asset or utility you need.
2. **Instantiate the registry or ledger** – each token exposes a constructor (e.g., `NewSYN500Token`) to create an in-memory registry.
3. **Populate metadata and balances** – register assets, mint supply, or configure governance depending on the token type.
4. **Compile and deploy** – integrate the token logic into smart contracts or services, then deploy via `synnergy` CLI or the GUI tool.
5. **Maintain lifecycle** – use provided methods for transfers, updates, and audits to keep on-chain data consistent.

## 3. Token Standards

### 3.0 Token Structure Overview
Every Synnergy token embeds the concurrency‑safe `BaseToken` type, which offers ERC‑style balances, allowances and transfer routines guarded by RWMutex locks for safe parallel execution【F:internal/tokens/base.go†L11-L47】【F:internal/tokens/base.go†L60-L112】. Registries and indices wrap `BaseToken` instances in mutex‑protected maps so enterprise deployments can mint, transfer and audit tokens across many goroutines without race conditions【F:internal/tokens/syn200.go†L31-L59】【F:internal/tokens/syn1000_index.go†L9-L27】. This layered structure lets higher‑level standards extend base behaviour with domain‑specific metadata while preserving deterministic accounting.

### 3.1 SYN130 – Tangible Asset Tokens
`TangibleAssetRegistry` registers real-world assets, updates valuations, records sales and manages leases for physical items【F:core/token_syn130.go†L8-L95】.
- **Data structures** – `TangibleAsset` captures owner, valuation, sale history and optional `LeaseInfo`, while `Syn130SaleRecord` tracks each transfer.
- **Core operations** – `Register`, `UpdateValuation`, `RecordSale`, `StartLease`, and `EndLease` maintain a complete lifecycle log for each physical item.
- **Enterprise applications** – supports inventory financing, collateral tracking and depreciation audits under mutex‑protected maps for high‑volume asset portfolios.

### 3.2 SYN131 – Intangible Asset Tokens
`SYN131Registry` mints unique intangible-asset entries and allows valuation updates and lookups for digital rights【F:core/syn131_token.go†L5-L45】.
- **Data structures** – `SYN131Token` stores name, symbol, owner and valuation, while the registry maintains a map of issued tokens.
- **Core operations** – `Create`, `UpdateValuation`, and `Get` manage digital-only property such as patents or licences.
- **Enterprise applications** – enables marketplaces to tokenise intellectual property and perform royalty or IP-rights management at scale.
- **CLI usage** – `synnergy syn131 create --id <id> --name <name> --symbol <symbol> --owner <owner> [--valuation <val>]` issues a token; `synnergy syn131 value <id> <val>` updates valuation and `synnergy syn131 get <id>` retrieves details.

### 3.3 SYN500 – Utility Tokens
`NewSYN500Token` issues tiered service credits; `Grant` assigns usage quotas and `Use` consumes them with limit enforcement【F:core/syn500.go†L5-L43】.
- **Data structures** – `ServiceTier` tracks tier, maximum allotment and usage counters inside the token’s `Grants` map.
- **Core operations** – `Grant` allocates quotas, `Use` deducts consumption and revocation is handled by deleting the grant entry.
- **Enterprise applications** – ideal for API usage plans or software subscriptions where credits must be allocated and depleted safely across many accounts.

### 3.4 SYN700 – Intellectual Property Tokens
`IPRegistry` registers creative works, attaches licences and logs royalty payments for each licence holder【F:core/syn700.go†L8-L80】.
- **Data structures** – `IPTokens` hold metadata plus licence and royalty collections; `License` and `RoyaltyPayment` record contractual terms and payouts.
- **Core operations** – `Register`, `CreateLicense`, `RecordRoyalty`, and `Get` keep perpetual histories of ownership and revenue shares.
- **Enterprise applications** – publishers can automate licensing agreements, royalty splits and compliance reporting for large content libraries.

### 3.5 SYN800 – Real-World Asset Tokens
`AssetRegistry` stores valuation, location and certification metadata for asset-backed instruments and supports valuation updates【F:core/syn800_token.go†L8-L48】.
- **Data structures** – `AssetMetadata` records description, valuation, location, asset type and certification information with timestamps.
- **Core operations** – `Register`, `UpdateValuation`, and `Get` maintain provenance and audit trails for collateralised goods.
- **Enterprise applications** – banks and custodians can digitise vault contents or warehouse receipts with chain-of-custody guarantees.

### 3.6 SYN1300 – Supply Chain Tokens
`SupplyChainRegistry` captures location and status events so logistics stakeholders can register assets and append provenance updates【F:core/syn1300.go†L8-L56】.
- **Data structures** – `SupplyChainAsset` embeds location, owner and an event `History` made of `SupplyChainEvent` entries.
- **Core operations** – `Register`, `Update`, and `Get` provide a tamper-evident trail from origin to delivery.
- **Enterprise applications** – supports cross‑organisational logistics, enabling manufacturers and shippers to reconcile inventory and compliance data.
- **CLI usage** – `synnergy syn1300 register --id <id> --desc <description> --owner <owner> --loc <location>` registers assets; `synnergy syn1300 update <id> --loc <location> [--status <status>] [--note <note>]` appends events and `synnergy syn1300 get <id>` shows current state.

### 3.7 SYN1401 – Investment Tokens
`InvestmentRegistry` issues interest-bearing positions, accrues returns over time and redeems principal plus interest at maturity【F:core/syn1401.go†L8-L74】.
- **Data structures** – each `InvestmentRecord` stores principal, rate, maturity and accrued amounts.
- **Core operations** – `Issue`, `Accrue`, and `Redeem` automate fixed-income lifecycle management.
- **Enterprise applications** – asset managers can structure debt instruments, pooled notes or revenue-share deals with deterministic yield tracking.
- **CLI usage** – `synnergy syn1401 issue --id <id> --owner <owner> --principal <amount> --rate <annual_rate> --maturity <unix>` issues an investment; `synnergy syn1401 get <id>` retrieves records and `synnergy syn1401 redeem <id> <owner>` settles matured positions.

### 3.8 SYN1600 – Music Royalty Tokens
`MusicToken` tracks song metadata, assigns royalty shares and distributes payouts proportionally to share holders【F:core/syn1600.go†L8-L70】.
- **Data structures** – token metadata stores title, artist and album, with `royaltySplits` mapping recipients to shares.
- **Core operations** – `Update`, `SetRoyaltyShare`, `Distribute`, and `Info` settle royalties transparently.
- **Enterprise applications** – record labels and streaming platforms can manage catalogues and automate complex royalty splits across thousands of artists.
- **CLI usage** – `synnergy syn1600 init --title <title> --artist <artist> --album <album>` initialises metadata; `synnergy syn1600 update [--title <title>] [--artist <artist>] [--album <album>]` adjusts fields and `synnergy syn1600 info` displays them.

### 3.9 SYN1700 – Event Ticket Tokens
`EventMetadata` manages ticket issuance, transfers and verification for limited-supply events【F:core/syn1700_token.go†L8-L75】.
- **Data structures** – `EventMetadata` holds event details and a map of `Ticket` records keyed by ID.

## How to deploy a contract

# How to Deploy a Contract

Blackridge Group Ltd provides a deterministic smart‑contract environment in the
Synnergy Network. Contracts are compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed via
the `synnergy` command‑line interface (CLI), yielding an immutable address
derived from the bytecode hash. This guide describes how to publish and manage
contracts on the network.

## Prerequisites

- **Synnergy CLI** – build the `cmd/synnergy` binary or obtain a release build.
  Building from source ensures the toolchain matches the runtime used by the
  network:

  ```bash
  go build ./cmd/synnergy
  ./synnergy --help
  ```

  The binary exposes the `contracts`, `contract-mgr`, `xcontract` and
  `ai_contract` subcommands. Ensure the executable is on your `PATH` or export
  `BIN_PATH` for helper scripts.
- **Compiled contract** – a WASM file or template provided by the project.
- **Owner address** – the account that will control the contract.
- **Gas limit** – maximum execution gas per call. Defaults to `100000` but can
  be adjusted during deployment.
- **(Optional) Ricardian manifest** – JSON manifest providing human‑readable
  context for legal or compliance purposes.
- **Network access** – a node endpoint configured with sufficient permissions
  to accept deployment transactions.

## Step‑by‑Step Deployment

### 1. Compile the contract

Use the CLI to compile source WAT/WASM into deterministic bytecode. Under the
hood `CompileWASM` validates the source and computes a SHA‑256 digest that
serves as the future contract address:

```bash
synnergy contracts compile path/to/src.wat
```

### 2. Deploy the contract

The `deploy` subcommand registers the compiled bytecode with the on‑chain
registry. Provide the WASM path, optional manifest, gas limit and owner:

```bash
synnergy contracts deploy \
  --wasm path/to/contract.wasm \
  --ric path/to/manifest.json \
  --gas 150000 \
  --owner <owner_address>
```

The command reads the specified files, stores the manifest if supplied and
returns the contract address for subsequent interactions.

#### Ricardian manifest structure

A manifest is a small JSON document that links the bytecode to a human‑readable
description and legal terms. Typical fields include a title, descriptive text
and optional jurisdictional clauses:

```json
{
  "title": "StorageMarket",
  "description": "Decentralised file‑rental contract",
  "terms": "See https://blackridge.example/terms/storage"
}
```

Manifests are immutable once deployed and should be stored in version control
alongside the WASM to guarantee reproducibility.

### 3. Verify deployment

List deployed contracts or inspect a specific one:

```bash
synnergy contracts list
synnergy contracts info <address>
```

### 4. Invoke the contract

Execute exported methods with `contracts invoke`. Gas defaults to the limit set
at deployment unless overridden:

```bash
synnergy contracts invoke <address> --method transfer --args "<hex_bytes>" --gas 50000
```

Outputs include the return bytes and gas consumed, enabling deterministic
testing of business logic.

## Internal Architecture

Understanding how Synnergy processes contracts clarifies why addresses and gas
usage are deterministic.

### Contract registry

The registry persists contract metadata—owner, manifest, gas limit and paused
state—and derives addresses from the SHA‑256 hash of the WASM bytecode.
Concurrent access is guarded by read/write mutexes to ensure thread safety
during deployments and invocations【F:contracts.go†L10-L18】【F:contracts.go†L57-L78】.

### Virtual machine

Execution is handled by the `SimpleVM`, a lightweight interpreter that supports
resource‑tuned modes. Profiles range from `VMHeavy` for high throughput to
`VMSuperLight` for constrained devices. Each mode controls a concurrency limiter
and enforces gas caps before dispatching opcodes【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L11-L72】【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L96-L108】.

## Deploying Contract Templates

Synnergy ships precompiled templates for common use cases. Enumerate available
artifacts and deploy them with a single command:

```bash
synnergy contracts list-templates
synnergy contracts deploy-template \
  --name token_faucet \
  --owner <owner_address> \
  --gas 100000
```

Templates provide predictable gas costs and vetted bytecode, expediting
development for standard token faucets, storage markets, DAO governance modules,
NFT minting, AI model markets and more. Template names correspond to `.wasm`
files stored under `smart-contracts/`.

## Scripted Deployment

For automation, use the provided helper script. It verifies prerequisites and
invokes the CLI on your behalf:

```bash
scripts/deploy_contract.sh path/to/contract.wasm
```

The script ensures the binary exists and aborts on missing or invalid input. It
respects `BIN_PATH` to locate a custom CLI build and exits non‑zero if the
deployment fails, making it suitable for continuous‑integration pipelines.
Override the binary location by exporting `BIN_PATH` prior to invocation:

```bash
export BIN_PATH=/opt/synnergy/bin/synnergy
scripts/deploy_contract.sh contract.wasm
```

## Managing Deployed Contracts

After deployment, the registry and manager modules expose maintenance
operations:

- **Transfer ownership** – reassign a contract to a new account.
- **Pause or resume** – temporarily disable execution.
- **Upgrade bytecode** – replace the WASM and optionally adjust the gas limit.

These actions are available programmatically through the `ContractManager`
abstraction and enable controlled life‑cycle management without redeploying from
scratch. The CLI exposes these capabilities via the `contract-mgr` command:

```bash
synnergy contract-mgr transfer <addr> <new_owner>
synnergy contract-mgr pause <addr>
synnergy contract-mgr resume <addr>
synnergy contract-mgr upgrade <addr> <wasm_hex> <gas_limit>
synnergy contract-mgr info <addr>
```

Under the hood these commands call `ContractManager` methods that update the
registry while emitting OpenTelemetry spans. Transfer, pause, resume, upgrade
and info operations validate addresses and mutate ownership or bytecode in a
thread‑safe manner【F:core/contract_management.go†L20-L84】【F:core/contract_management.go†L86-L96】.

Each operation emits structured errors with telemetry spans, facilitating
enterprise monitoring and audit trails.

### Advanced Registries

Synnergy extends the base registry with specialised modules for complex
deployments:

- **AI contracts** – `ai_contract deploy` requires both WASM and a model hash;
  gas is validated against minimum thresholds before storing the mapping【F:core/ai_enhanced_contract.go†L38-L55】.
  Invoke inference with:

  ```bash
  synnergy ai_contract invoke <addr> <input_hex> <gas_limit>
  ```

- **Cross‑chain mappings** – `xcontract register` links a local contract to a
  remote chain and exposes `list`, `get` and `remove` operations. Each command
  optionally emits JSON for machine consumption【F:cli/cross_chain_contracts.go†L25-L98】.

- **Contract marketplace** – `marketplace deploy` uploads bytecode while
  enforcing gas pricing, and `marketplace trade` reassigns ownership via the
  embedded manager【F:core/smart_contract_marketplace.go†L11-L53】.

These registries extend the core deployment flow for specialised enterprise
scenarios without altering the deterministic base address.

## Enterprise Deployment Considerations

- **Environment separation** – maintain distinct testnet, staging and
  production nodes. Deterministic addresses make migrations predictable across
  environments.
- **Secrets management** – store owner keys in hardware modules or vaults and
  inject them at runtime rather than hard‑coding.
- **Continuous integration** – run `go test` and `mkdocs build` before
  promotion; the helper script's non‑zero exits integrate with CI failure
  thresholds.
- **Observability** – telemetry spans emitted by `ContractManager` operations
  feed into OpenTelemetry collectors for audit trails and performance analysis.
- **Disaster recovery** – export manifests and bytecode to version control so
  identical addresses can be recreated after catastrophic loss.
- **Throughput planning** – select a `SimpleVM` mode (`VMHeavy`, `VMLight`,
  `VMSuperLight`) that aligns with node capacity. Concurrency limits prevent a
  single deployment from exhausting resources【F:core/virtual_machine.go†L11-L72】.
- **Gas governance** – integrate `GasCost` lookups in CI to ensure supplied gas
  meets protocol‑defined minima before submitting transactions.

## Operational Monitoring and Error Codes

`contract-mgr` and related CLIs surface errors with machine‑parsable codes using
the internal error package, printing messages like `error (NOT_FOUND): contract
not found` for integration with alerting pipelines【F:cli/contract_management.go†L87-L93】.
Telemetry spans emitted from manager and marketplace operations provide latency
metrics and success/failure tags that feed directly into enterprise dashboards.

## Best Practices

- Audit contracts and manifests before deployment.
- Allocate sufficient gas to prevent out‑of‑gas failures.
- Record the returned contract address securely; it is derived from the SHA‑256
  hash of the bytecode and acts as the canonical identifier.
- Use version control and test suites to validate upgrades prior to production
  deployment.
- Tag releases with the contract address to maintain a clear provenance trail.
- Run `contracts info` regularly to verify manifests have not been tampered with
  and `contract-mgr info` to confirm owner and paused status.
- Consider using the AI and cross‑chain registries only after security reviews,
  as they expand the attack surface.

## Troubleshooting

- **`--wasm required`** – ensure the `--wasm` flag points to a valid file.
- **`contract already deployed`** – bytecode hash matches an existing contract.
  Modify the code or use `ContractManager` to upgrade.
- **`contract not found`** – verify the address when invoking or managing a
  contract.
- **`contract paused`** – resume via `contract-mgr resume` or review pause
  policy.
- **`wasm bytecode required`** – indicates empty or corrupted file during an
  upgrade. Re‑compile and retry.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, developers can confidently deploy and administer
smart contracts on the Synnergy Network under the Blackridge Group Ltd
umbrella. The deterministic tooling and accompanying templates streamline
contract lifecycles while preserving security and auditability. Whether rolling
out a single template or orchestrating a fleet of cross‑chain and AI contracts,
the platform provides a reproducible foundation for enterprise workflows.

1. **Hold authority status** – membership is validated against the on‑chain registry through `IsAuthorityNode`, ensuring only registered addresses can release funds【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L98-L103】.
2. **Have network access to the LoanPool CLI**, hardened credentials and an auditable signing environment.
3. **Verify treasury capacity** – administrators can inspect current balances and counts with `LoanPoolManager.Stats` before disbursement【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L31-L44】.
4. **Confirm pool availability** – use `loanmgr pause`/`resume` to control proposal intake during maintenance windows【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L19-L29】.

## 4. Review Proposal Status
Disbursement is only permitted for proposals that have been approved and not yet paid. Run the proposal processing step to update approval flags:

```bash
synnergy loanpool tick
```

The `Tick` routine scans active proposals and marks any with at least one vote as approved prior to their deadline【F:core/loanpool.go†L50-L56】.

List proposals and inspect the specific request:

```bash
synnergy loanpool list
synnergy loanpool get [id]
```

Confirm that `approved` is `true` and `disbursed` is `false` in the returned JSON view before continuing.

## 5. Disbursement Workflow
Once approval is confirmed:

1. **Execute the disbursement command**:

   ```bash
   synnergy loanpool disburse [id]
   ```

   The CLI delegates to the `Disburse` method which validates approval, checks that the proposal has not previously been paid, confirms sufficient treasury, and then deducts the amount from the pool【F:cli/loanpool.go†L51-L58】【F:core/loanpool.go†L60-L74】.  
   Validate the payout by re-running `loanmgr stats` to see updated treasury figures【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L31-L37】.

2. **Record the transaction** in internal ledgers and compliance systems for future audits.

### Disbursing Loan Applications
Retail applications managed via `loanpool_apply` follow an analogous flow:

```bash
synnergy loanpool_apply disburse [id]
```

This command triggers the application disbursement routine which performs the same approval and treasury checks before marking the application as paid【F:cli/loanpool_apply.go†L53-L60】【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L67-L81】.

## 6. Administrative Safeguards
Enterprise operators should employ the following controls:

- **Pause or resume submissions** to manage incident response or system upgrades via `loanmgr pause` and `loanmgr resume`【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L19-L29】.
- **Cancel or extend proposals** when creators request changes or need more time, using `loanpool cancel` or `loanpool extend`【F:cli/loanpool.go†L97-L120】【F:core/loanpool.go†L93-L117】.
- **List outstanding work** with `loanpool list` to maintain visibility across proposals【F:cli/loanpool.go†L87-L95】.

## 7. Post-Disbursement & Audit

- **Verify updated pool metrics** using `LoanPoolManager.Stats` to ensure treasury balances and disbursement counters reflect the transaction【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L31-L44】.
- **Archive proposal views** for governance records using `synnergy loanpool get [id]` after the payout; the view serialises all vote counts and flags for retention【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L35】.
- **Feed audit trails** into internal compliance platforms and monitoring dashboards for continuous oversight.
- **Monitor remaining treasury** for future grants to maintain liquidity targets set by Blackridge Group Ltd.

## 8. Troubleshooting

Common errors returned by the disbursement routines include:

- `proposal not approved or already disbursed` – the proposal is either pending approval or has been paid already.
- `insufficient treasury` – pool balance is below the requested amount.
- `loan pool is paused` – new proposals are blocked until `loanmgr resume` is executed【F:core/loanpool.go†L26-L33】【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L21-L28】.
- `application not approved or already disbursed` – analogous checks for loan applications.

Re-run `tick` to process approvals, verify authority status, or replenish treasury before retrying.

## 9. Security and Governance Notes

- Only authority nodes validated by Blackridge Group Ltd may invoke disbursement routines. Attempting to disburse from an unregistered address will fail the `IsAuthorityNode` check【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L98-L103】.
- Execute all commands over secure channels with hardware-backed keys, and replicate logs to the enterprise monitoring stack.
- Use administrative pause and resume controls to isolate incidents or coordinate multi-region upgrades【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L19-L29】.

By following these steps, authority nodes ensure that LoanPool grants and loans are released in a controlled, transparent, and compliant manner consistent with Blackridge Group Ltd governance standards.

## How to get a syn900 id token

# How to Get a SYN900 ID Token

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. issues the **SYN900** identity token as the cornerstone of user authentication on the Synnergy Network. Each token binds a wallet address to verified personal details, enabling compliant participation across modules such as the LoanPool, Charity Pool and governance portals. Unlike traditional credentials, the SYN900 token is privacy‑preserving and auditable, allowing services to confirm identity without exposing raw documentation.

## Why the SYN900 Token Matters
- **Access control** – Contracts and services gate sensitive actions to proven identities. For example, the Charity Pool verifies token holders before counting a vote, rejecting any address without a registered ID【F:core/charity.go†L103-L110】.
- **Regulatory compliance** – LoanPool submissions require a verified identity token and up‑to‑date KYC/AML logs, ensuring accountability and legal adherence【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/How apply for a grant or loan from loanpool.md†L11-L18】【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/How apply for a grant or loan from loanpool.md†L154-L159】.
- **Reusable authentication** – Once issued, the SYN900 token can authenticate the holder across any Synnergy module, removing redundant checks while retaining a complete audit trail.
- **Programmatic registry integration** – The IDRegistry maps wallet addresses to descriptive metadata and exposes constant‑time lookups for services that must confirm enrolment before delivering benefits or fee distributions【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Transaction fee distribution.md†L106-L110】.
- **Auditable KYC trail** – The `ComplianceService` hashes submitted documents and records fraud signals, preserving a tamper‑evident audit history without revealing sensitive data【F:compliance.go†L61-L73】【F:compliance.go†L83-L90】【F:compliance.go†L102-L109】.

## Prerequisites
Before requesting a SYN900 token, ensure that:
- You possess a Synnergy wallet address registered in the ID wallet registry【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L27】.
- Legal identification documents for KYC/AML checks, such as a passport or government‑issued ID.
- CLI or API access to submit commands through the identity and idwallet modules【F:cli/idwallet.go†L12-L44】【F:cli/identity.go†L13-L67】.
- Network connectivity to submit registration data to the IdentityService.
- Your address is not suspended by the ComplianceManager; suspended or flagged addresses cannot receive identity tokens【F:compliance_management.go†L30-L35】【F:compliance_management.go†L67-L77】.

## Step‑by‑Step Process
1. **Register the wallet** – Use the on‑chain `IDRegistry` to associate your wallet with metadata. The registry rejects duplicates by locking a mutex during writes and provides read‑only `Info` and `IsRegistered` helpers for external checks【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】.
2. **Submit identity details** – Call the `IdentityService.Register` method with your name, date of birth and nationality. Data is stored in a mutex‑protected map to maintain ledger integrity【F:identity_verification.go†L37-L46】.
3. **Complete verification** – Provide required KYC/AML evidence. Each verification method is persisted via `IdentityService.Verify`, appending a timestamped log entry for auditors and regulators【F:identity_verification.go†L48-L57】.
4. **Record compliance evidence** – Hash documents through `ComplianceService.ValidateKYC`, which stores an immutable commitment and audit entry for later review【F:compliance.go†L61-L73】.
5. **Issuance via IdentityTokenAPI** – After logs are validated, an authority node mints the SYN900 token using dedicated modules such as `tokens_syn900.go` and `tokens_syn900_index.go` which expose the IdentityTokenAPI【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/module_guide.md†L460-L461】.
6. **Receive the token** – The minted token is deposited into the registered wallet. Standard operations consume 90 gas units, matching the `StdSYN900` opcode budget【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md†L1458-L1462】.
7. **Use across the network** – Loan proposals, charity votes and governance actions validate the identity token automatically before proceeding.

### Command‑Line Example
```bash
synnergy idwallet register 0xABCD... "KYC reference"
synnergy identity register 0xABCD... "Alice" "1990-01-01" "UK"
synnergy identity verify 0xABCD... passport
synnergy identity info 0xABCD...
synnergy identity logs 0xABCD...
```
These commands wrap the `IDRegistry` and `IdentityService` interfaces, enabling scripted enrolment and audits【F:cli/idwallet.go†L12-L44】【F:cli/identity.go†L13-L67】.

## Smart‑Contract and Opcode Integration
- **Opcode hooks** – Identity functions surface at the VM layer through opcodes like `RegisterIdentity`, `VerifyIdentity`, and `RemoveIdentity`, allowing contracts to enforce enrollment checks directly【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L1052-L1055】【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L141-L145】.
- **Deterministic gas costs** – The opcode schedule assigns fixed budgets (500 gas for registration, 100 for verification, 200 for removal), helping enterprises plan resource consumption【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md†L1410-L1418】.

## Enterprise Integration and Compliance
- **Regulatory oversight** – `RegulatoryManager` catalogues jurisdiction‑specific rules and evaluates transactions, while `RegulatoryNode` flags non‑compliant addresses and records reasons for review【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L65】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L43】. Identity tokens provide the link between flagged addresses and real‑world entities.
- **Sovereign deployments** – Central banking nodes embed the `IdentityService` to vet participants before distributing CBDCs, leveraging the same audit logs for governmental compliance【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Central banks.md†L18-L19】.
- **Smart‑contract support** – Scaffolded DID registries in Solidity and Rust allow enterprises to integrate custom on‑chain identity workflows or extend SYN900 issuance logic【F:smart-contracts/solidity/DIDRegistry.sol†L1-L6】【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/did_registry.rs†L1-L10】.
- **Address suspension and whitelisting** – `ComplianceManager` can suspend, whitelist, or review transactions involving an address, preventing sanctioned entities from registering or transacting【F:compliance_management.go†L30-L77】.
- **Audit trails and risk scoring** – `ComplianceService` stores hashed KYC commitments, logs fraud signals and exposes risk scores and audit trails for investigators【F:compliance.go†L61-L90】【F:compliance.go†L94-L109】.
- **Role-based access** – `AccessController` grants, revokes and checks roles for operator wallets, supporting separation of duties in large organisations【F:access_control.go†L5-L24】【F:access_control.go†L38-L47】.

## Token Lifecycle and Compliance
- **Immutable records** – The `IdentityService` exposes `Info` and `Logs` to audit registered details and verification events without altering history【F:identity_verification.go†L60-L75】.
- **Ongoing verification** – Run `Verify` whenever documents expire or regulations change; updated logs keep the token in good standing.
- **Revocation and recovery** – If a wallet is compromised, re‑register a new address in the `IDRegistry` and repeat the verification flow to obtain a fresh token while preserving regulatory traceability【F:idwallet_registration.go†L20-L27】【F:identity_verification.go†L37-L57】.
- **Data privacy** – Only hashed or encrypted identifiers are stored on‑chain; personal documents remain off‑chain but linked via secure references.

## Security Best Practices
- Enable multi‑factor or hardware‑wallet authentication to guard the token.
- Monitor verification logs for unusual activity and escalate discrepancies to Blackridge Group Ltd. support.
- Use offline storage for seed phrases and rotate credentials when personnel change.
- Review regulatory flags periodically via `RegulatoryNode.Logs` to ensure ongoing compliance【F:regulatory_node.go†L32-L43】.
- Track `ComplianceService.RiskScore` to detect wallets accumulating fraud signals and respond before regulatory thresholds are breached【F:compliance.go†L83-L90】【F:compliance.go†L94-L100】.

## Additional Resources
- Token architecture and additional standards are documented in the Synnergy Network token catalogue【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Tokens.md†L184-L187】.
- Module guides and gas tables provide deeper insight into token operations and opcode budgeting【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/module_guide.md†L460-L461】【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md†L1458-L1462】.
- For economic incentives such as Passive Income distributions, consult the transaction fee distribution guide which shows how the `IDRegistry` underpins targeted payouts【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/Transaction fee distribution.md†L106-L110】.

## How to setup faucet

# How to Setup the Faucet

Blackridge Group Ltd. provides a built-in faucet to distribute small amounts of SYN tokens to developers and testers. The faucet enforces rate limits to prevent abuse while allowing quick access to funds for experimentation. This guide explains how to initialise, operate, and extend the faucet using the Synnergy Network toolset.

## Architecture Overview

The faucet maintains an internal balance and tracks the timestamp of each request. A thread-safe mutex guards shared state while a map records the last time each address drew funds. When a user requests tokens, the faucet verifies that sufficient balance remains and the caller has waited longer than the configured cooldown interval before dispensing funds【F:core/faucet.go†L9-L41】. Administrators can query the remaining balance and update the dispense amount or cooldown without redeploying the service【F:core/faucet.go†L44-L56】.

### Virtual Machine Opcodes

Faucet primitives are surfaced as deterministic opcodes in the Synnergy Virtual Machine. The opcode table assigns unique identifiers to creation, request, balance and configuration operations, enabling contracts or higher-level tooling to invoke faucet logic directly from the VM【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L596-L644】.

### Cross-Language Support

In addition to the Go implementation, the faucet model is available in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for lightweight deployments. The Rust module serialises owner, drip amount and wait-time fields and enforces per-account cooldowns using a hash map of last-request timestamps【F:smart-contracts/rust/src/token_faucet.rs†L1-L24】. A Solidity contract template offers comparable functionality for ERC-20 tokens on EVM-compatible chains【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L9-L45】.

### CLI Integration

The `synnergy` command-line interface exposes subcommands to manage the faucet. Initialisation sets the starting balance, the per-request amount, and the cooldown duration. Subsequent subcommands allow token requests, balance inspection, and configuration updates【F:cli/faucet.go†L14-L83】. For repetitive development tasks, the repository bundles a helper script that wraps the request command and provides basic argument validation【F:cmd/scripts/faucet_fund.sh†L1-L7】.

### Programmatic Usage

Services may embed the faucet directly using the Go APIs. A faucet instance tracks balance, dispense policy and last request time in a mutex-protected structure:

```go
f := core.NewFaucet(100, 10, time.Minute)
amt, err := f.Request("addr")
```

Requests fail with clear error messages when funds are exhausted or a caller triggers the cooldown【F:core/faucet.go†L29-L37】. Operators can adjust policy at runtime without redeploying by invoking `Configure` on the public library variant【F:faucet.go†L48-L53】.

### Error Handling

Typical errors returned by the faucet include:

- `cooldown active` – the address has requested funds too recently【F:core/faucet.go†L33-L34】.
- `insufficient faucet balance` – available tokens are below the dispense amount【F:core/faucet.go†L36-L37】.
- `faucet empty` or `cooldown period not met` when using the package-level faucet【F:faucet.go†L30-L34】.

Applications should surface these errors to end users and log them for auditability.

## Prerequisites

- **Synnergy CLI** – build the binary from `cmd/synnergy` or obtain a release build.
- **Node Access** – connectivity to a Synnergy Network node capable of accepting faucet transactions.
- **Funding Account** – an address that will supply the initial faucet balance.

## Initialising the Faucet

Create a faucet instance with an initial balance and policy settings:

```bash
synnergy faucet init --balance 1000 --amount 5 --cooldown 2m
```

- `--balance` – total tokens available for distribution.
- `--amount` – tokens dispensed per request.
- `--cooldown` – minimum interval between requests from the same address.

On success the CLI prints `faucet initialised`, indicating the structure is ready to serve requests.

## Requesting Tokens

Developers request tokens by supplying a destination address:

```bash
synnergy faucet request <address>
```

If the faucet is uninitialised or the cooldown has not elapsed, the command returns an error. Successful requests display the number of tokens dispensed.

## Checking Faucet Balance

Monitor remaining funds to ensure the faucet stays stocked:

```bash
synnergy faucet balance
```

The command prints the current balance, enabling operators to top up the faucet before depletion.

## Updating Configuration

Adjust the dispense amount or cooldown without restarting the service:

```bash
synnergy faucet config --amount 10 --cooldown 5m
```

This command calls `UpdateConfig`, replacing the previous policy values with the supplied parameters【F:core/faucet.go†L51-L56】【F:cli/faucet.go†L67-L83】.

## Deploying the Token Faucet Contract

For on-chain distribution, Synnergy ships a reusable `TokenFaucet` smart contract. The contract holds an ERC-20 token balance and restricts each address to one request per wait period【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L9-L28】. Owners can deposit additional tokens, adjust the drip amount, or withdraw excess funds as needed【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L31-L41】.

Deploy the template via the CLI:

```bash
synnergy contracts deploy-template --name token_faucet
```

Record the returned address and transfer tokens to it using the `deposit` function. Clients then call `requestTokens` to receive the configured drip amount.

### Opcode and Gas Costs

Faucet operations are implemented as first-class opcodes in the Synnergy Virtual Machine. Deploying a new faucet consumes 500 gas, while requests, balance queries, and configuration updates have zero runtime cost, enabling inexpensive developer onboarding【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md†L2699-L2712】. Gas table entries register predictable pricing for contract templates, including the faucet, so costs remain stable across releases【F:gas_table.go†L23-L31】.

## Automation and Testing

Continuous integration pipelines deploy and verify the faucet contract using the same CLI commands documented above. The contract test harness invokes the `deploy-template` subcommand, captures the returned address and asserts that the deployment is registered in the contract listing【F:tests/contracts/faucet_test.go†L43-L61】. Unit tests also validate cooldown behaviour and configuration updates in the core library【F:core/faucet_test.go†L8-L23】. A placeholder script exists for automating contract deployment in shell environments, offering a starting point for bespoke CI workflows【F:scripts/deploy_faucet_contract.sh†L1-L17】.

## Best Practices

- **Maintain Sufficient Balance** – monitor usage and replenish the faucet to avoid service interruptions.
- **Tune Cooldowns** – longer intervals reduce abuse on public testnets; shorter intervals facilitate rapid prototyping in isolated environments.
- **Secure the Funding Account** – only authorised personnel should control the account that tops up or withdraws from the faucet.
- **Audit Smart Contracts** – when using the on-chain faucet, review the contract code and access controls before deployment.
- **Log Requests** – capture request metadata and outcomes to support auditing and anomaly detection.

## Enterprise Deployment Considerations

Large organisations often host faucets for multiple internal teams or external partners. To sustain heavy traffic:

- **Horizontal Scaling** – run multiple faucet instances behind a load balancer and share a backing account to prevent bottlenecks. The mutex-protected design ensures each instance processes requests safely even under concurrency【F:core/faucet.go†L9-L41】.
- **Observability** – integrate request and balance metrics with existing monitoring suites to track utilisation and forecast top-ups.
- **Access Control** – restrict who can adjust drip parameters or withdraw funds by leveraging owner-only functions in the contract template【F:smart-contracts/solidity/TokenFaucet.sol†L33-L41】.
- **Disaster Recovery** – back up faucet configuration and funding accounts, and script redeployment to minimise downtime.
- **Scriptable Workflows** – pair the CLI with automation tools or use the provided shell scripts to seed test accounts during continuous delivery pipelines【F:cmd/scripts/faucet_fund.sh†L1-L7】.

## Conclusion

The Synnergy faucet, engineered by Blackridge Group Ltd., accelerates development by providing rate-limited test tokens through both CLI utilities and smart-contract templates. By following the steps above, operators can reliably configure faucets for internal labs or public testnets, ensuring seamless onboarding and controlled token distribution across the Synnergy Network.

## How to setup the blockchain

# How to Set Up the Synnergy Blockchain

*Blackridge Group Ltd.*

## Overview
The Synnergy framework is a modular, high‑performance blockchain built in Go. Its pluggable architecture allows organisations to compose customised networks featuring validator, mining, staking, regulatory and watchtower roles. This guide provides a comprehensive walk‑through for preparing infrastructure, compiling binaries and bootstrapping a Synnergy network using the open‑source toolset maintained by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**

## 1. Prerequisites
### Hardware & Network
- 4+ CPU cores and 8 GB RAM per node
- Stable broadband connection; low‑latency links for validator clusters
- 40 GB free storage for ledger growth and contract artefacts

### Software Stack
- **Go 1.24+** – required for all binaries (verify with `go version`)
- **Git** for source management
- **Make** for convenience targets and scripted builds
- **jq**, **curl** and other POSIX tools used by automation scripts
- **Docker / Kubernetes / Terraform** optional for containerised or cloud deployments
- **OpenSSL** and `bash` utilities for certificate and script operations

Execute `scripts/install_dependencies.sh` to bootstrap these packages on a clean system.

## 2. Obtain the Source
```bash
git clone https://example.com/Synnergy.v.1.git
cd Synnergy.v.1
```
The repository layout follows a clean separation between command‑line entry points (`cmd/`), modular CLI commands (`cli/`), runtime components (`core/`), and deployment manifests (`deploy/`, `docker/`).

## 3. Build the Binaries
The primary node binary lives under `cmd/synnergy` and orchestrates network services.
```bash
make build                 # invokes `go build ./...`
# build with explicit tags
make build-prod            # production optimisations

# or build just the node
go build ./cmd/synnergy
```
Successful compilation produces a `synnergy` executable at the repository root. Additional commands such as `watchtower`, `p2p-node`, or `smart_contracts` can be built using the same pattern. Run `make test` afterwards to ensure the workspace compiles and all unit tests pass.

## 4. Configure the Environment
Synnergy consumes a YAML configuration resolved from the `SYN_CONFIG` environment variable. If unset, `internal/config/default.go` points to `configs/dev.yaml` for development defaults.
```yaml
environment: development
log_level: debug
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8080
database:
  url: "https://dev-db.example.com"
```
Additional templates reside in `configs/prod.yaml` and `configs/test.yaml`. Duplicate a template and adjust values for staging or production. Configuration keys are validated with `github.com/go-playground/validator` ensuring correct log levels and port ranges.

Network parameters such as chain IDs or bootstrap peers can be centralised in `configs/network.yaml`.

Create an optional `.env` file to pre‑set environment variables; the entry point loads it via `gotenv.Load()`.

## 5. Initialize the Genesis Block
The `synnergy` CLI exposes a `genesis` module for bootstrapping the ledger. Adjust `configs/genesis.json` to set the chain ID, genesis timestamp and treasury wallets:
```bash
./synnergy genesis show                 # display default wallet allocations
./synnergy genesis allocate 1000000000  # compute distribution for initial supply
./synnergy genesis init                 # commit the first block and return stats
```
Genesis addresses include allocations for development, charity, authority nodes and validators. The call to `InitGenesis` returns block height and circulating supply information for auditability.

## 6. Start Network Services
With configuration and genesis complete, launch the base node and peer‑to‑peer layer:
```bash
export SYN_CONFIG=configs/dev.yaml
./synnergy network start             # initialise gossip and RPC servers
./synnergy basenode start            # run core services on the current machine
./synnergy network peers             # verify connectivity
```
The base node listens on the `server.host` and `server.port` defined in `configs/<env>.yaml` and exposes a gRPC/REST control plane alongside the gossip layer.  Internally, `core.NewNode` assembles several subsystems:
- `Ledger` for balances and transaction application
- `SynnergyConsensus` for validator selection and block production
- `SNVM` virtual machine for smart‑contract execution
- `Firewall` and `SystemHealthLogger` for defensive monitoring
- Mempool and blockchain arrays for pending and committed state

To engage specialised roles use dedicated commands:
```bash
./synnergy mining start              # activate `core.NewMiningNode`
./synnergy staking_node start        # begin staking service
./synnergy watchtower start          # launch network guardian
./synnergy regulatory_node start     # enable compliance hooks
```
Startup wrappers such as `scripts/startup.sh`, `scripts/node_setup.sh` and `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh` configure environment variables, generate certificates and launch processes.  Consensus administration utilities — `scripts/consensus_start.sh`, `scripts/consensus_validator_manage.sh`, `scripts/consensus_recovery.sh` and `scripts/consensus_finality_check.sh` — manage validator elections, recover stalled rounds and verify finality proofs.  Each wrapper constructs the corresponding node type (e.g., `core.NewWatchtowerNode`) on top of the base infrastructure.

## 7. Manage Validators and Stake
Validator participation is controlled through the `ValidatorNode` composition in `core/validator_node.go` which wraps `ValidatorManager` and `QuorumTracker` components. Typical lifecycle:
```bash
./synnergy staking_node stake <addr> <amount>   # register stake
./synnergy validator add <addr> <stake>         # join validator set
./synnergy validator remove <addr>              # exit and release stake
```
Quorum thresholds, slashing and rehabilitation are handled automatically by the node using `SlashValidator`, `ReportDowntime` and related routines. The `scripts/stake_penalty.sh` helper can simulate infractions to verify slashing rules.

## 8. Key Management and Wallet Operations
Wallet creation and identity attestation are handled by `core/wallet.go` and `idwallet_registration.go`. Use the CLI to generate and register wallets:
```bash
./synnergy wallet new --out mywallet.json --password <passphrase>
./synnergy idwallet register <address> '<metadata>'
./synnergy idwallet check <address>
```
Operational scripts such as `scripts/wallet_init.sh`, `scripts/wallet_key_rotation.sh`, `scripts/wallet_multisig_setup.sh` and `scripts/wallet_offline_sign.sh` automate provisioning, key rotation, multisignature coordination and offline signing. For regulated environments `scripts/idwallet_register.sh` captures KYC data and ties wallets to verified identities.

## 9. Deploy Smart Contracts
The runtime embeds a virtual machine (`core.NewSNVM`) and contract registry (`core.NewContractRegistry`). Contracts reside under `smart-contracts/` (WebAssembly templates) and `smart-contracts/solidity/` (reference Solidity implementations).  Typical lifecycle:
```bash
./synnergy contracts compile <src.wasm> --out build/          # compile contract
./synnergy contracts deploy build/src.wasm --from <addr>      # deploy to chain
./synnergy contracts invoke <addr> <method> [args]            # execute entrypoint
./synnergy contracts query <addr> <state-key>                 # read contract state
```
Gas usage is deterministically priced through `synnergy.LoadGasTable()` and `synnergy.RegisterGasCost()` calls executed during start‑up.  Pre‑deployment checks are orchestrated via:

- `scripts/contract_static_analysis.sh` – run `gosec` and `wasm-verify` across sources
- `scripts/contract_language_compatibility_test.sh` – ensure cross‑language parity with Solidity templates
- `scripts/contract_coverage_report.sh` – generate execution coverage from `tests/contracts/`
- `scripts/deploy_contract.sh` and `scripts/deploy_starter_smart_contracts_to_blockchain.sh` – push artefacts to a node
- `scripts/upgrade_contract.sh` – perform in‑place upgrades using proxy patterns

These utilities validate bytecode, enforce deterministic gas schedules and document deployments for audit trails.

## 10. Cross‑Chain Interoperability
Bridging, connection management and relay functionality live in `core/cross_chain.go`, `cross_chain_bridge.go`, `cross_chain_connection.go` and supporting types. The CLI exposes these capabilities via dedicated commands:
```bash
# register and inspect bridges
./synnergy cross_chain register <source> <target> <relayer>
./synnergy cross_chain list --json
./synnergy cross_chain authorize <bridge_id> <relayer>

# manage connections and asset transfers
./synnergy cross_chain_connection open <local> <remote>
./synnergy cross_chain_bridge deposit <bridge_id> <from> <to> <amount>
./synnergy cross_chain_bridge claim <transfer_id> <proof>
```
Scripts including `scripts/cross_chain_setup.sh`, `scripts/cross_chain_bridge.sh`, `scripts/cross_chain_connection.sh` and `scripts/cross_chain_transactions.sh` orchestrate channel creation, relayer whitelisting and transfer proofs for production environments.

## 11. High Availability and Monitoring
Resilient deployments combine active‑active replicas with watchtower oversight. Scripts within `scripts/` facilitate cluster management:
```bash
scripts/high_availability_setup.sh
scripts/ha_failover_test.sh
scripts/metrics_export.sh
scripts/metrics_alert_dispatch.sh
```
Operational telemetry is available through:
```bash
./synnergy system_health snapshot    # one‑off metrics
./synnergy system_health log         # stream structured logs
```
The node initialises a no‑op OpenTelemetry tracer (`otel.SetTracerProvider`) allowing integration with external collectors when desired.

## 12. Production Deployment Options
**Docker Compose**
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
Builds the `synnergy` image and launches an example node.

**Kubernetes (Helm)**
```bash
helm install synnergy deploy/helm/synnergy
```
Use values overrides to specify image tags, replicas and resource limits.

**Terraform & Ansible**
```bash
cd deploy/terraform
terraform init && terraform apply -var 'ami_id=ami-123456'
ansible-playbook -i <inventory> deploy/ansible/playbook.yml
```
These templates provision infrastructure, configure nodes and enforce hardened defaults.

## 13. Security & Compliance
Run static analysis and vulnerability checks prior to production rollout:
```bash
make security          # staticcheck, gosec, govulncheck
scripts/pki_setup.sh   # generate CA and node certificates
scripts/aml_kyc_process.sh
scripts/firewall_setup.sh
scripts/compliance_audit.sh
```
Core services such as `firewall.go`, `access_control.go`, `anomaly_detection.go`, `ai_secure_storage.go` and `identity_verification.go` can be enabled to harden the runtime against unauthorised access and data leakage. `scripts/multi_factor_setup.sh` provisions multi‑factor authentication, while `scripts/ai_drift_monitor.sh` and `scripts/ai_privacy_preservation.sh` enforce model integrity and data minimisation for AI components.

Additional modules cover biometric authentication (`core.NewBiometricService`), zero‑trust channels (`core.NewZeroTrustEngine`) and regulatory reporting (`core.NewRegulatoryNode`).


## 14. Node Roles and Specialised Services
Synnergy supports a broad spectrum of node roles so organisations can tailor deployments to regulatory, analytical and operational needs. Each role extends the base ledger, consensus and virtual-machine stack while remaining interoperable on the common P2P layer. Setup scripts initialise keys, configuration and health checks.

**Core Infrastructure**
- **Base Node (`core/base_node.go`)** – fundamental networking and ledger services; initialise with `scripts/node_setup.sh` or `scripts/full_node_setup.sh`.
- **Full Node (`core/full_node.go`)** – archives every block and transaction for full validation and historical queries.
- **Light Node (`core/light_node.go`)** – header-only client for constrained devices; provision using `scripts/light_node_setup.sh`.
- **Gateway Node (`core/gateway_node.go`)** – exposes RPC endpoints and balances peer connections for inbound traffic.
- **Validator Node (`core/validator_node.go`)** – participates in consensus rounds; managed via `scripts/consensus_start.sh` and `scripts/consensus_validator_manage.sh`.

**Financial & Governance Roles**
- **Custodial Node (`core/custodial_node.go`)** – maintains wallets and executes transactions on behalf of clients; configure with `scripts/custodial_node_setup.sh`.
- **Audit Node (`core/audit_node.go`)** – verifies ledger integrity for compliance teams; pair with `scripts/forensic_node_setup.sh` and `scripts/immutable_audit_log_export.sh`.
- **Bank Institutional Node (`core/bank_institutional_node.go`)** – integrates with traditional banking platforms; bootstrap using `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh`.
- **Central Banking Node (`core/central_banking_node.go`)** – enforces monetary policy and treasury operations; provision through `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh` and `scripts/treasury_manage.sh`.
- **Government Authority Node (`core/government_authority_node.go`)** – executes regulatory oversight; deploy with `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh`.
- **Elected Authority Node (`core/elected_authority_node.go`)** – dynamically chosen governance role; install via `scripts/authority_node_setup.sh`.
- **Regulatory Node (`regulatory_node.go`)** – evaluates transactions against jurisdictional policy. `scripts/regulatory_node_setup.sh` loads rule templates and `scripts/regulatory_report.sh` exports audit logs.
- **Consensus-Specific Node (`core/consensus_specific_node.go`)** – bridges differing consensus networks; configured by `scripts/consensus_specific_node.sh` and `scripts/cross_consensus_network.sh`.

**Analytical & Archival Roles**
- **Indexing Node (`indexing_node.go`)** – thread-safe in-memory key/value index enabling fast ledger queries. Provision with `scripts/indexing_node_setup.sh`.
- **Content Node (`content_node.go`)** – publishes off-chain artefacts for decentralised storage markets. `scripts/content_node_setup.sh` advertises content via P2P discovery.
- **Forensic Node (`core/forensic_node.go`, `node_ext/forensic_node.go`)** – captures immutable evidence for investigations; prepared with `scripts/forensic_node_setup.sh` and `scripts/forensic_data_export.sh`.
- **Historical Node (`core/historical_node.go`, `node_ext/historical_node.go`)** – retains complete archival state; initialise using `scripts/historical_node_setup.sh` and `scripts/immutable_log_snapshot.sh`.
- **Holographic Node (`internal/nodes/holographic_node.go`)** – experimental holographic storage and retrieval service bootstrapped via `scripts/holographic_node_setup.sh` and `scripts/holographic_storage.sh`.
- **Experimental Node (`internal/nodes/experimental_node.go`)** – sandbox for preview features requiring manual configuration.
- **Optimization Node (`cli/optimization_node.go`)** – performance-tuned build deployed with `scripts/optimization_node_setup.sh`.

**Operational & Monitoring Roles**
- **Watchtower Node (`watchtower_node.go`)** – monitors forks and misbehaviour; run `scripts/watchtower_node_setup.sh` and enable alerts with `scripts/tamper_alert.sh`.
- **Warfare Node (`warfare_node.go`)** – maintains logistics and tactical messaging for defence scenarios; provision with `scripts/warfare_node_setup.sh`.
- **AI Service Nodes (`ai_drift_monitor.go`, `ai_inference_analysis.go`, `ai_model_management.go`)** – deliver drift detection, explainability and model-lifecycle tooling; automate with `scripts/ai_inference_analysis.sh`, `scripts/ai_model_management.sh` and companions.

**Specialised Extensions**
- **Biometric Security Node (`biometric_security_node.go`)** – stores biometric templates and verifies enrolment using secure channels. `scripts/biometric_enroll.sh` and `scripts/biometric_security_node_setup.sh` manage onboarding.
- **Geospatial Node (`geospatial_node.go`)** – appends location coordinates to transactions to enforce regional policies. Initialise through `scripts/geospatial_node_setup.sh`.
- **Energy-Efficient Node (`energy_efficient_node.go`)** – records energy consumption and issues sustainability certificates; use `scripts/energy_efficient_node_setup.sh` to bind hardware metrics and offset ledgers.
- **Environmental Monitoring Node (`environmental_monitoring_node.go`)** – streams sensor feeds to sustainability analytics. `scripts/environmental_monitoring_node_setup.sh` configures data ingestion endpoints.
- **Mining Node (`mining_node.go`)** – configurable proof-of-work miner. Deploy using `scripts/mining_node_setup.sh` for stationary rigs or `scripts/mobile_mining_node_setup.sh` for mobile devices.
- **Mobile Mining Node (`mobile_mining_node.go`)** – lightweight miner for mobile hardware; initialise with `scripts/mobile_mining_node_setup.sh`.
- **Staking Node (`staking_node.go`)** – tracks delegated stakes and exposes balances to the validator set. `scripts/staking_node_setup.sh` prepares stake directories and retention policies.

Each node type composes the shared services with domain-specific logic, enabling enterprises to mix roles within a single network while preserving interoperability.

## How to use the CLI

# How to Use the CLI

The Synnergy command-line interface (CLI) is the primary gateway for interacting with the Synnergy blockchain. Developed and maintained by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, the `synnergy` binary enables administrators, validators, institutions, and developers to operate nodes, manage on-chain assets, and integrate with external systems. This guide provides an end‑to‑end overview of installation, command structure, and the most common operational workflows.

## 1. Installation
### 1.1 Build from Source
```bash
go build ./cmd/synnergy   # or: make build
```
The resulting `synnergy` executable is placed in the repository root. Build tags such as `-tags prod` can be supplied for environment‑specific defaults. Verify the binary and configuration with:
```bash
./synnergy --version
echo $SYN_CONFIG  # confirms active config file
```

### 1.2 Configuration
Synnergy reads a YAML configuration file whose path is resolved from the `SYN_CONFIG` environment variable. Development nodes default to `configs/dev.yaml` while production builds point to `configs/prod.yaml`.

## 2. Command Structure and Conventions
Synnergy uses the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) framework. Commands follow the pattern:
```bash
synnergy <module> <subcommand> [flags] [arguments]
```
Global flags include `--json` for machine‑readable output and `--help` for in‑line documentation. All modules are registered beneath the root command defined in `cli/root.go`.

## 3. Core Modules
### 3.1 Network Operations
Control the peer‑to‑peer layer, publish messages, and monitor connectivity:
```bash
synnergy network start
synnergy network peers
synnergy network broadcast topic "payload"
```
Supported subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `peers`, `broadcast`, `subscribe`.

### 3.2 Wallet Management
Generate encrypted wallets for signing transactions:
```bash
synnergy wallet new --out wallet.json --password secret
```
The command prints the address and optionally persists an encrypted keystore to disk.

### 3.3 Authority Governance
Register authority nodes, cast votes, and inspect the registry:
```bash
# Application lifecycle
synnergy authority_apply submit node1 validator "candidate node"
synnergy authority_apply vote voterA <appID> true
synnergy authority_apply finalize <appID>
synnergy authority_apply get <appID> --json
synnergy authority_apply list --json
synnergy authority_apply tick

# Registry management
synnergy authority register node1 validator
synnergy authority vote voterA node1
synnergy authority info node1 --json
synnergy authority elect 5
synnergy authority is node1
synnergy authority list --json
synnergy authority deregister node1
```
`authority_apply` manages candidacy, voting, and finalisation, while `authority` maintains the active registry.

### 3.4 Banking Integration
Institutions can register participation and query supported node types:
```bash
synnergy bankinst register MyBank
synnergy bankinst list --json
synnergy bankinst is MyBank
synnergy banknodes types
```
These modules expose the institutional registry and enumerate allowed banking node roles.

### 3.5 Liquidity Pools
Create pools, add liquidity, execute swaps, and inspect state:
```bash
synnergy liquidity_pools create TOKENA TOKENB 25
synnergy liquidity_pools add TOKENA-TOKENB provider1 1000 1000
synnergy liquidity_pools swap TOKENA-TOKENB TOKENA 50 45
synnergy liquidity_pools remove TOKENA-TOKENB provider1 500
synnergy liquidity_pools info TOKENA-TOKENB
synnergy liquidity_views list
```
`liquidity_pools` performs state‑changing operations; `liquidity_views` provides read‑only inspection.

### 3.6 Cross-Chain Bridge
Lock assets for transfer to other chains and release them using proofs:
```bash
synnergy cross_chain_bridge deposit bridge1 alice bob 100 TOKENX
synnergy cross_chain_bridge list --json
synnergy cross_chain_bridge get <transferID> --json
synnergy cross_chain_bridge claim <transferID> <proof>
```
Transfers can be listed or fetched individually, each reporting deterministic gas costs.

### 3.7 Coin Economics
Query monetary parameters and perform economic calculations:
```bash
synnergy coin info
synnergy coin reward 100000
synnergy coin supply 100000
synnergy coin price C R M V T E
synnergy coin alpha 0.3 0.8 0.5 0.1
synnergy coin minstake 500000 10 1000000 0.2
```
Each subcommand validates numeric inputs and emits either plain text or JSON depending on `--json`.

### 3.8 Consensus Coordination
Tune the adaptive consensus engine or measure transition thresholds:
```bash
synnergy consensus mine 5
synnergy consensus weights
synnergy consensus adjust 0.7 0.3
synnergy consensus threshold 0.5 0.6
synnergy consensus difficulty 1.0 0.9 1.0
synnergy consensus availability true true false
synnergy consensus powrewards true
```
These commands mine test blocks, display and adjust PoW/PoS/PoH weights, and toggle reward or availability parameters.

### 3.9 Smart Contract Lifecycle
Compile, deploy, invoke, and manage WebAssembly contracts:
```bash
synnergy contracts compile contract.wat
synnergy contracts deploy --wasm build/contract.wasm --gas 200000 --owner addr1
synnergy contracts invoke <address> --method run --args "payload" --gas 5000
synnergy contracts list
synnergy contracts deploy-template --name token_faucet --owner addr1
synnergy contracts list-templates

# Administrative management
synnergy contract-mgr pause <address>
synnergy contract-mgr resume <address>
synnergy contract-mgr upgrade <address> <wasmHex> 250000
synnergy contract-mgr info <address>
```
`contracts` handles compilation and deployment, while `contract-mgr` transfers ownership, pauses execution, and upgrades bytecode.

### 3.10 Testnet Faucet
Bootstrap local testing by minting tokens from the faucet:
```bash
synnergy faucet init --balance 1000 --amount 10 --cooldown 1m
synnergy faucet request addr1
synnergy faucet balance
synnergy faucet config --amount 5 --cooldown 30s
```
The faucet must be initialised before requests are honoured.

### 3.11 Loan Pool Governance
Submit and manage community lending proposals:
```bash
synnergy loanpool submit creatorA recipientB microloan 500 "startup capital"
synnergy loanpool vote voter1 1
synnergy loanpool disburse 1
synnergy loanpool get 1
synnergy loanpool list
synnergy loanpool cancel creatorA 1
synnergy loanpool extend creatorA 1 24
synnergy loanpool tick
```
Loans accrue votes until disbursement or cancellation; `tick` processes expirations.

### 3.12 Charity Pool Distribution
Register charities, collect votes, and audit allocations:
```bash
synnergy charity_pool register addr1 1 "WaterAid"
synnergy charity_pool vote voter1 addr1
synnergy charity_pool winners
synnergy charity_mgmt donate donor1 100
synnergy charity_mgmt withdraw addr1 50
```
Registrations and winners can be queried per cycle to verify transparent fund dispersal.

### 3.13 Identity Verification
Maintain identity profiles and verification logs:
```bash
synnergy identity register addr1 "Alice" 1990-01-01 UK
synnergy identity verify addr1 passport
synnergy identity info addr1
synnergy identity logs addr1
```
Profiles record name, date of birth, nationality, and the methods used to verify an address.

### 3.14 Biometric Security Node
Offload authentication to a dedicated biometric node:
```bash
synnergy bsn enroll addr1 "iris-scan" <pubKeyHex>
synnergy bsn auth addr1 "iris-scan" <sigHex>
synnergy bsn addtx addr1 "iris-scan" <sigHex> fromAddr toAddr 10 1 1
```
The node stores biometric templates, authenticates signatures, and can queue signed transactions for propagation.

### 3.15 Regulatory Management
Govern jurisdiction‑specific transaction policies:
```bash
synnergy regulator add reg1 EU "GDPR limit" 1000
synnergy regulator list
synnergy regulator evaluate 500
synnergy regulator remove reg1
```
Rules can be added or removed dynamically, and every transaction amount can be evaluated against active limits.

### 3.16 Node Operations
Inspect and maintain a running node:
```bash
synnergy node info
synnergy node stake addr1 1000
synnergy node slash addr1 double
synnergy node rehab addr1
synnergy node addtx fromAddr toAddr 10 1 1
synnergy node mempool
synnergy node mine
```
Nodes track validator stakes, record penalties, accept transactions into the mempool, and mine blocks on demand.

### 3.17 Validator Management
Operate the consensus validator set:
```bash
synnergy validator add addr1 1000
synnergy validator remove addr1
synnergy validator slash addr1
synnergy validator eligible
synnergy validator stake addr1
synnergy validator set-min 5000
```
Commands register validators, adjust their stake, and enforce minimum staking thresholds.

### 3.18 Fee and Gas Utilities
Estimate fees and inspect opcode gas tables:
```bash
synnergy fees estimate --type transfer --units 2 --tip 1 --load 0.3
synnergy fees feedback --message "estimates high"
synnergy fees share 100 60 40
synnergy gas list
synnergy gas set 5 50
synnergy gas snapshot --json
```
`fees` calculates cost breakdowns while `gas` snapshots or adjusts opcode pricing for deterministic budgeting.

### 3.19 Compliance Operations
Validate KYC data, track fraud, and run anomaly detection:
```bash
synnergy compliance validate kyc.json
synnergy compliance erase addr1
synnergy compliance fraud addr1 4
synnergy compliance risk addr1
synnergy compliance audit addr1
synnergy compliance monitor tx.json 0.8
synnergy compliance verifyzkp blob.bin 0xcommit 0xproof
```
All commands accept `--json` for structured auditing.

### 3.20 Audit Logs
Record and review event trails:
```bash
synnergy audit log addr1 login ip=1.2.3.4
synnergy audit list addr1 --json
```
Each entry captures timestamped metadata for compliance and forensic analysis.

### 3.21 Private Transactions
Encrypt payloads and submit confidential transactions:
```bash
synnergy private-tx encrypt key "secret"
synnergy private-tx decrypt key <hexdata>
synnergy private-tx send encrypted_tx.json
```
Payloads are symmetrically encrypted and relayed through a privacy-preserving manager.

### 3.22 DAO Governance
Create member‑driven organisations:
```bash
synnergy dao create DevDAO creator1
synnergy dao join daoID addr1
synnergy dao leave daoID addr1
synnergy dao info daoID
synnergy dao list
```
The manager issues unique IDs and enforces membership operations.

### 3.23 Historical Ledger
Archive block summaries and retrieve historical data:
```bash
synnergy historical archive 100 abcd1234
synnergy historical height 100
synnergy historical hash abcd1234
synnergy historical total
```
Archived summaries capture height, hash, and timestamp for audit‑grade lineage.

### 3.24 High Availability Failover
Configure backup nodes for rapid failover:
```bash
synnergy highavailability init primary1 30
synnergy highavailability add backup1
synnergy highavailability heartbeat backup1
synnergy highavailability active
```
The manager tracks heartbeat signals and automatically promotes a standby when the primary is unresponsive.

### 3.25 Watchtower Monitoring
Run a watchtower node to supervise network health:
```bash
synnergy watchtower start
synnergy watchtower fork 500 badhash
synnergy watchtower metrics
synnergy watchtower stop
```
Metrics report CPU, memory, peer count, and block height with timestamped snapshots.

### 3.26 Rollups
Aggregate transactions into batches with fraud proofs:
```bash
synnergy rollups submit tx1 tx2
synnergy rollups challenge batchID 0 proof
synnergy rollups finalize batchID true
synnergy rollups info batchID
synnergy rollups list
synnergy rollups txs batchID
synnergy rollups pause
synnergy rollups resume
synnergy rollups status
```
Rollup batches can be paused, resumed, challenged, or finalised to scale throughput.

### 3.27 Sharding
Manage shard leaders and cross‑shard traffic:
```bash
synnergy sharding leader get 1
synnergy sharding leader set 1 addr1
synnergy sharding map
synnergy sharding submit 0 1 txhash
synnergy sharding pull 1
synnergy sharding reshard 4
synnergy sharding rebalance 75
```
Sharding commands rebalance load and route cross‑shard transaction receipts.

### 3.28 Sidechains
Register and administer auxiliary chains:
```bash
synnergy sidechain register chain1 "meta" val1 val2
synnergy sidechain header chain1 header
synnergy sidechain get-header chain1
synnergy sidechain meta chain1
synnergy sidechain list
synnergy sidechain pause chain1
synnergy sidechain resume chain1
synnergy sidechain update-validators chain1 val3 val4
synnergy sidechain remove chain1
synnergy sidechain deposit chain1 addr1 100
synnergy sidechain withdraw chain1 addr1 50 proof
```
Each side‑chain maintains independent headers, validator sets, and escrow operations for deposits and withdrawals.

### 3.29 Plasma Bridge
Control the Plasma asset bridge:
```bash
synnergy plasma-mgmt pause
synnergy plasma-mgmt resume
synnergy plasma-mgmt status --json
```
Pausing safeguards bridge operations during upgrades or incident response.

## 4. JSON Output and Automation
Most operational commands support a `--json` flag to aid scripting and GUI integration. For example, `synnergy authority_apply list --json` returns a serialized array of applications, and `synnergy coin --json info` outputs key/value pairs describing the coin parameters. Structured output simplifies downstream tooling, log aggregation, and API responses.

## 5. Infrastructure Automation
Infrastructure‑as‑code tooling underpins reproducible deployments:
```bash
cd deploy/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -var 'ami_id=ami-123456'

ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy/ansible/playbook.yml
```
Terraform provisions cloud resources while Ansible configures nodes with hardened defaults.

## 6. Testing and Continuous Integration
Run the full suite to verify CLI behaviour and runtime contracts:
```bash
go test ./...
```
Integration tests execute commands against in‑memory nodes and wallet services to ensure end‑to‑end flow integrity across releases.

## 7. Operational Guidance
For enterprise deployments, pair CLI workflows with observability and policy controls:
- **Structured logging** – every command emits deterministic strings that can be forwarded to SIEM pipelines.
- **Role separation** – limit privileged subcommands (e.g., `contract-mgr` and `regulator`) to secured service accounts.
- **Environment parity** – maintain dedicated config files for development, staging, and production to ensure reproducible builds.
- **Disaster recovery** – export wallet files and configuration snapshots regularly to support node restoration.

Blackridge Group Ltd. maintains the Synnergy CLI as an enterprise‑grade interface for blockchain administration. Continual testing and automation ensure the tool remains reliable for both manual operators and scripted workflows.

## How to use the Synnergy Network Consensus

# How to Use the Synnergy Network Consensus

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. created the Synnergy Network to provide a resilient foundation for compliant decentralised finance. Its consensus layer combines proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) so operators can tune performance, security and energy profile without redeploying nodes. This guide explains how to interact with the consensus engine, configure its behaviour and participate in block production.

## Hybrid Consensus Architecture
Synnergy’s engine assigns a relative weight to each algorithm and continually re‑balances them using network demand and stake concentration. A fresh engine starts with a 40/30/30 weighting for PoW, PoS and PoH and exposes parameters \(Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Dmax, Smax\) to govern threshold calculus and smoothing【F:core/consensus.go†L11-L88】.

### Weight Parameters and Thresholds
`SynnergyConsensus` exposes `Threshold(D,S)` and `TransitionThreshold(D, threat, S)` to model load, security risk and stake concentration. `AdjustWeights` smooths changes using `Gamma`, clamps each mechanism to a 7.5\% floor and renormalises totals so weights always sum to one【F:core/consensus.go†L55-L119】.

### Dynamic Mode Hopping
The `ConsensusHopper` monitors transactions per second, average latency and the number of active validators, selecting the most appropriate mode for the next epoch. High throughput with sub‑second latency favours PoS, small validator sets tilt toward PoH, and all other conditions fall back to PoW【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L17-L70】. A read–write mutex protects mode selection and metric history so concurrent callers can query or override the hopper without races【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L24-L55】.

### Manual Overrides and Metric Inspection
Enterprise operators may temporarily pin the network to a single mode for maintenance windows or incident response. `SetMode` bypasses automatic heuristics and immediately switches to the requested mechanism, while `LastMetrics` returns the data that informed the most recent evaluation so administrators can justify overrides【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L43-L55】.

### Sub-block Workflow and Double-Lock Finality
During PoS or PoH epochs, block intervals are split into four sub‑steps: proposal, pre‑finalisation, PoW aggregation and finalisation. Pre‑finalised sub‑blocks provide near‑instant confirmation, while PoW aggregation secures the chain against long‑range attacks. Minted rewards are distributed 50 % to PoS validators, 10 % to PoH schedulers and 40 % to PoW miners, with validator payouts proportional to stake and participation【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L380-L416】.

Transaction fees follow a separate allocation path and are apportioned among validators, miners and other network funds according to the fee distribution contract【F:core/fees.go†L115-L125】.

Sub‑blocks encapsulate ordered transactions, validator identity and a PoH‑derived hash which is signed by the proposer; the consensus engine verifies that each sub‑block is non‑empty and bears a valid signature before inclusion in the final PoW block【F:core/block.go†L10-L43】【F:core/consensus.go†L180-L188】.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Go toolchain and access to the Synnergy CLI.
- Network connectivity to a ledger peer.
- Appropriate staking tokens if participating as a validator.

### Creating a Consensus-Specific Node
Use the `consensus-node` command to lock a node to a single consensus mode. The `create` subcommand accepts the mode (pow, pos or poh), an identifier and a network address. Subsequent helpers expose the node state through `info`, mine blocks with `mine`, and allocate stake on the local ledger via `stake <address> <amount>` so the node can participate in validator selection【F:cli/consensus_specific_node.go†L13-L76】.

### Deploying Validator Nodes
`ValidatorNode` bundles a base node with a `ValidatorManager` and `QuorumTracker`. Use `AddValidator`, `RemoveValidator` or `SlashValidator` to manage membership, and `HasQuorum` to ensure sufficient active stake before proceeding【F:core/validator_node.go†L5-L47】. `ValidatorManager` enforces minimum stake requirements and records slashing events, halving stake balances when `Slash` is invoked【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L11-L65】.


## Operating the Consensus Engine
### Inspecting and Adjusting Weights
The `consensus` command group exposes operational controls. Use `weights` to display the current distribution, `adjust [demand] [stake]` to recalculate weights, and `threshold` or `transition` to compute switching thresholds based on demand, threat level and stake concentration【F:cli/consensus.go†L15-L114】.

### Difficulty and Availability Controls
`difficulty [old] [actual] [expected]` recalculates PoW difficulty for a target block time using `old * (actual/expected)`【F:core/consensus.go†L121-L128】. `availability [pow] [pos] [poh]` toggles validator availability flags, and `powrewards [enabled]` enables or disables mining incentives without altering other modes【F:cli/consensus.go†L115-L180】.

### Mining a Block
For development or testing, `mine [difficulty]` creates a dummy block with an adjustable difficulty target and reports the discovered nonce【F:cli/consensus.go†L19-L36】.

## Validator Management
Synnergy selects validators using a weighted random algorithm that rejects sets where the largest stake exceeds half of the total, preventing dominance. Each sub‑block must include transactions and a valid validator signature before inclusion in a block【F:core/consensus.go†L144-L188】. The validator management layer maintains per‑address stake and slashing state and instruments add, remove and slash operations with telemetry spans for auditability【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L11-L65】. Validator nodes wrap these controls and quorum tracking so governance decisions immediately affect participation【F:core/validator_node.go†L23-L47】.


## Stake Management and Slashing
Operators may apply discretionary penalties or rewards using the `StakePenaltyManager`. `AdjustStake` modifies balances, `Penalize` appends timestamped records and `Info` returns the current stake with full history. The CLI exposes `stake_penalty slash <addr> <amount>` and `stake_penalty reward <addr> <amount>` for on‑chain enforcement【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L61】【F:cli/stake_penalty.go†L15-L49】.

## High Availability and Failover
For enterprise resilience, `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and promotes the freshest backup when the primary misses a configurable timeout. CLI helpers initialise the manager, register backups, record heartbeats and report the active node for orchestration systems【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】【F:cli/high_availability.go†L14-L72】.

## System Health Monitoring
Blackridge ships a `SystemHealthLogger` for telemetry beyond consensus events. It samples goroutine counts, memory allocation, peer connectivity and block height, storing the latest snapshot for dashboards or alerting systems【F:core/system_health_logging.go†L11-L44】.

## Security, Transparency and Telemetry
All mode changes and validator metrics are logged for public inspection. Administrators may pin modes or adjust weights, but every decision is recorded, enabling external auditors to replay consensus events and verify fairness【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L384-L436】. Core validator operations emit OpenTelemetry spans so monitoring systems can trace stake changes and slashing actions in real time【F:core/consensus_validator_management.go†L28-L57】【F:internal/telemetry/telemetry.go†L1-L10】.

## Best Practices
- Monitor `ConsensusHopper` metrics to anticipate mode shifts and plan infrastructure capacity.
- Maintain diverse validator participation to avoid triggering the selection guardrail and to maximise reward share.
- Review telemetry feeds and logs regularly for signs of latency spikes or validator churn.
- Configure failover heartbeats and promote backups automatically to keep block production uninterrupted.
- Audit stake penalty history to detect recurring misbehaviour and refine governance policies.
- Stream system health snapshots to watchtower or equivalent observability stacks to forecast resource needs.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network consensus, engineered by Blackridge Group Ltd., delivers flexible, observable and secure block production. By understanding the hybrid architecture and operational tooling described above, network participants can confidently deploy nodes, manage staking positions and tune performance to meet evolving requirements.

## How to vote for authority node

# How to Vote for an Authority Node

## Introduction
Authority nodes form the governance backbone of the Synnergy Network. They vet
proposals, oversee compliance modules and safeguard the chain’s long‑term
stability. Voting is the mechanism by which the community and existing
authorities grant or withhold this power. This guide from **Blackridge Group
Ltd.** explains how to evaluate candidates and cast authoritative votes using
both the application workflow and the live registry.

## 1. Governance Model
Each authority node is identified by an address, a declared role and the set of
voters that have endorsed it. These properties are tracked in the
`AuthorityNodeRegistry`, which exposes thread‑safe registration and voting
primitives【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L12-L67】. Votes are stored as a map of
voter addresses, allowing quick tallying through the `TotalVotes` helper and a
weight‑based electorate sampler for committee formation【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L19-L96】.

## 2. Prerequisites
1. **Candidate Application** – prospective authorities must submit an
   application and gather preliminary approvals. See [How to Become an
   Authority Node](./How%20to%20become%20an%20authority%20node.md) for the full
   lifecycle.
2. **Synnergy CLI** – install the `synnergy` binary or build it from source.
3. **Wallet Access** – voters and candidates require funded addresses capable of
   signing governance actions.

## 3. Voting on Applications
During the application phase, votes determine whether a candidate is admitted to
the registry.

```bash
synnergy authority_apply list --json      # view pending applications
synnergy authority_apply vote <voter> <appID> <true|false>
```

The `authority_apply` module records approval and rejection sets for each
submission and validates inputs before updating the tally【F:cli/authority_apply.go†L21-L41】.
Finalisation promotes approved candidates to registered authority nodes:

```bash
synnergy authority_apply finalize <appID>
```

Applications carry a time‑to‑live and are garbage‑collected if not finalized.
The manager timestamps each submission and prunes expired or already processed
entries via `Tick`, ensuring stale requests cannot linger in the queue【F:core/authority_apply.go†L23-L30】【F:core/authority_apply.go†L106-L114】.

## 4. Voting for Registered Nodes
Once a node is registered, community members may express ongoing support or
participate in committee selection using the registry commands.

```bash
synnergy authority vote <voter> <candidate>      # cast a vote
synnergy authority info <candidate>              # inspect vote count
synnergy authority elect 3                      # sample top 3 electorate
```

These commands delegate to the registry’s `Vote`, `Info` and `Electorate`
methods to update vote maps, retrieve node metadata and assemble
vote‑weighted committees【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L33-L52】【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L57-L88】.

## 5. Managing Votes
Voters may withdraw support by removing their ballot, and operators can verify
membership status or list all authorities for audit purposes.

```bash
synnergy authority vote <voter> <candidate>      # cast or update a vote
synnergy authority list --json                   # inspect registry
synnergy authority deregister <candidate>        # remove node (admin only)
```

While the CLI focuses on casting votes, the registry also exposes a
`RemoveVote` method for custom tooling to withdraw support when necessary.
Registry queries such as `IsAuthorityNode` and `List` enable health checks and
automation scripts【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L69-L129】. Unit tests exercise
vote casting, electorate sampling and vote removal to guarantee deterministic
behaviour【F:core/authority_nodes_test.go†L5-L36】.

## 6. Audit and Automation
The registry is backed by an `AuthorityNodeIndex` that supports snapshotting
for consistent reads and deterministic JSON output for downstream services.
Operators can safely iterate over a `Snapshot` or export the index through
`MarshalJSON` for integration with monitoring systems and dashboards【F:core/authority_node_index.go†L55-L67】.

CLI commands mirror this machine‑readable philosophy. Both `authority` and
`authority_apply` expose `--json` flags on `info`, `list` and `get` commands
to facilitate scripted audits and GUI consumption【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L54-L92】【F:cli/authority_apply.go†L54-L93】.

## 7. Advanced Governance Roles
Beyond simple registrations, the codebase provides specialised authority node
constructs. `ElectedAuthorityNode` embeds a term limit and includes `IsActive`
to verify whether its mandate has expired【F:core/elected_authority_node.go†L5-L19】.
`GovernmentAuthorityNode` models regulator‑operated validators and hard‑codes
restrictions against minting SYN coins or altering monetary policy, enforcing
separation of duties in regulated environments【F:core/government_authority_node.go†L5-L27】.

## 8. Example Workflow
1. **Submit and Review Application**
   - Candidate runs `synnergy authority_apply submit <addr> <role> "description"`.
   - Voters inspect with `synnergy authority_apply list`.
2. **Cast Votes**
   - Supporters use `synnergy authority_apply vote <voter> <id> true`.
   - Opponents supply `false` to reject.
3. **Finalize and Register**
   - When quorum is met, run `synnergy authority_apply finalize <id>`.
   - Successful candidates appear in `synnergy authority list`.
4. **Ongoing Support**
   - Cast registry votes via `synnergy authority vote`.
   - Use `synnergy authority elect <n>` to draw committee members for special
     tasks.

## 9. Best Practices
* **Due Diligence** – verify candidate identity and infrastructure prior to
  voting. Use `synnergy authority info` to review accumulated support.
* **Transparent Record‑Keeping** – output `--json` from CLI commands for audit
  trails and integration with governance dashboards.
* **Active Participation** – revisit votes periodically and remove support for
  inactive or non‑compliant nodes.

## How to write a contract

# How to Write a Contract

Blackridge Group Ltd. provides a powerful framework for authoring, deploying and managing smart contracts on the Synnergy Network. This guide walks developers through the full contract lifecycle—from selecting a language to managing upgrades—so that every contract adheres to our enterprise standards for security, performance and regulatory compliance.

## Prerequisites

- **Development environment** with the Synnergy CLI available in `cmd/synnergy`.
- Familiarity with WebAssembly (WASM) and smart contract concepts.
- Access to a test node or sandbox environment for validation.

## Choosing a Contract Language

The Synnergy virtual machine supports multiple high‑level languages that compile to the network’s opcode set. Supported options include WASM, Go, JavaScript, Solidity, Rust, Python and Yul【F:contract_language_compatibility.go†L5-L16】. Use the language best aligned with your team’s expertise and project requirements.

```go
if !synnergy.IsLanguageSupported(lang) {
    log.Fatalf("unsupported contract language: %s", lang)
}
```

## Structuring the Contract

Each deployed contract is represented by the `Contract` struct, which captures deterministic addressing, ownership and execution constraints【F:contracts.go†L10-L18】. Design your contract with these fields in mind:

- **Address** – derived from the SHA‑256 hash of the compiled WASM.
- **Owner** – account responsible for upgrades and lifecycle decisions.
- **Manifest** – optional Ricardian contract describing intent.
- **GasLimit** – maximum gas per invocation to protect against runaway execution.

## Mapping to Opcodes

Every exported function maps to a stable opcode so the virtual machine can dispatch calls deterministically. The `ContractOpcode` type pairs human‑readable names with numeric codes and the network publishes the full list in `ContractOpcodes`【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L1-L12】. Lookups are performed through helpers such as `opcodeByName`, which translate a function name to its encoded value【F:contracts_opcodes.go†L1403-L1421】. Reserve unique names and corresponding opcodes during design to maintain compatibility across tooling and audits.

## Compiling to WASM

Use the `CompileWASM` helper to convert source code into bytecode and compute its hash for addressing【F:contracts.go†L46-L55】.

```go
wasm, addrHash, err := synnergy.CompileWASM(src)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

The returned hash becomes the on‑chain address used in subsequent operations.

## Deploying the Contract

Contracts are registered through the `ContractRegistry`. Deployment requires the WASM bytecode, optional manifest, gas limit and owner address【F:contracts.go†L57-L79】.

```go
registry := synnergy.NewContractRegistry(vm)
addr, err := registry.Deploy(wasm, manifestJSON, gasLimit, owner)
```

For command‑line workflows, the provided script wraps this functionality:

```bash
scripts/deploy_contract.sh path/to/contract.wasm
```

This script validates the binary path and invokes `synnergy contracts deploy --wasm <file>`【F:scripts/deploy_contract.sh†L1-L28】.

## Invoking Contract Methods

Once deployed, methods are executed via the registry, which routes calls through the configured virtual machine and enforces gas limits and pause status【F:contracts.go†L82-L98】.

```go
output, gasUsed, err := registry.Invoke(addr, "Execute", args, suppliedGas)
```

## Enumerating and Auditing Contracts

The registry exposes helpers for discovering and validating deployed artifacts. `List` returns every tracked contract while `Get` fetches metadata for a specific address【F:contracts.go†L100-L116】. These APIs are safe for concurrent use and underpin audit tooling across Blackridge Group Ltd.

```go
for _, c := range registry.List() {
    fmt.Printf("%s owned by %s\n", c.Address, c.Owner)
}
```

## Testing and Simulation

Unit tests should exercise deployment and invocation flows prior to mainnet release. The `TestContractRegistry` test demonstrates compiling bytecode, deploying it to a local `SimpleVM`, and verifying output【F:contracts_test.go†L5-L24】. Reproduce similar tests for your contract to validate logic and gas consumption deterministically.

## Formal Verification and Fuzzing

Beyond unit tests, the codebase scaffolds advanced validation. Formal verification hooks exist to integrate theorem provers and assert protocol invariants before launch【F:tests/formal/contracts_verification_test.go†L1-L7】. Complementary fuzz tests feed random byte streams into the virtual machine to reveal edge cases and panics early in development【F:tests/fuzz/vm_fuzz_test.go†L1-L8】.

## Managing the Contract Lifecycle

Administrative operations are handled by the `ContractManager`, enabling owners to transfer control, pause execution, resume, upgrade bytecode or query metadata【F:core/contract_management.go†L15-L96】. Each method is instrumented with OpenTelemetry spans so lifecycle events appear in enterprise dashboards.

- `Transfer` – change contract ownership.
- `Pause`/`Resume` – toggle execution availability.
- `Upgrade` – replace WASM and optionally adjust gas limits.
- `Info` – retrieve current metadata.

## Cross‑Chain Mapping

For applications spanning multiple networks, the `XContractRegistry` records relationships between local and remote contract addresses【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L5-L55】. Register mappings to coordinate cross‑chain calls and asset transfers.

```go
xreg := synnergy.NewXContractRegistry()
xreg.RegisterMapping(localAddr, "RemoteChain", remoteAddr)
```

Mappings can later be enumerated or removed using `ListMappings`, `GetMapping` and `RemoveMapping` to keep cross‑chain relationships current【F:cross_chain_contracts.go†L34-L55】.

## Integrating External Data and Secure Channels

Many contracts rely on off‑chain inputs or confidential messaging. Thread‑safe `DataFeed` structures allow contracts to consume timestamped key/value updates from external systems without race conditions【F:data_operations.go†L8-L28】. When transmitting sensitive payloads, the `ZeroTrustEngine` opens encrypted channels using Ed25519 keys and signed messages to maintain end‑to‑end confidentiality【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L33】.

## Security and Best Practices

- Conduct comprehensive testing and formal verification before deployment.
- Set conservative gas limits to mitigate denial‑of‑service vectors.
- Maintain version control of manifests and WASM artifacts for auditability.
- Leverage pause and upgrade controls to respond to vulnerabilities quickly.
- Enforce role‑based permissions with the `AccessController` to constrain privileged operations【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】.

## Regulatory Compliance and Privacy Controls

Enterprise deployments often operate under multiple jurisdictions. The `RegulatoryManager` stores per‑region rules—such as transaction limits—and evaluates them before execution to ensure adherence to local mandates【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L35】. For sensitive state transitions, AES‑GCM helpers encrypt and decrypt payloads so that private data remains confidential across the network【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L27】【F:private_transactions.go†L30-L38】.

## CLI Automation

Operational teams can manage contracts through the CLI. The `contract-mgr` command wraps lifecycle operations such as `transfer`, `pause`, `resume`, `upgrade` and `info`【F:cli/contract_management.go†L18-L84】, surfacing coded errors when expectations are not met【F:cli/contract_management.go†L87-L92】.

## Observability, Error Handling and Telemetry

Enterprise deployments require traceability and consistent error semantics. All management functions emit spans via the shared tracer【F:internal/telemetry/telemetry.go†L8-L10】 and return structured errors with codes like `not_found` and `invalid`【F:internal/errors/errors.go†L5-L49】. Instrumentation enables real‑time monitoring, while coded errors simplify automated remediation.

The network’s `SystemHealthLogger` supplements tracing by exporting runtime metrics—including goroutine counts, memory use, peer cardinality and block height—so operators can correlate contract activity with node health in watchtower dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L1-L35】.

## Gas Accounting and Resource Profiles

The `SimpleVM` offers configurable execution profiles—heavy, light and super light—controlled by `VMMode` to balance throughput against resource limits【F:virtual_machine.go†L11-L58】. Gas usage per opcode is resolved through the dynamically loaded gas table, allowing dashboards to calculate costs with `GasCost` and related helpers【F:gas_table.go†L18-L106】.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines, developers can author robust, maintainable smart contracts that leverage the full capabilities of the Synnergy Network while meeting the quality standards of Blackridge Group Ltd. Continued enhancements to tooling and runtime will further streamline contract development across our ecosystem.

## Ledger replication and distribution

# Ledger Replication and Distribution

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, relies on a resilient ledger replication and distribution architecture to guarantee data integrity across all participating nodes. Each node maintains a verifiable copy of the blockchain, ensuring consensus, fault tolerance, and rapid recovery from failures.

## Architectural Objectives
- **Consistency:** Every node should converge on the same ledger state after block propagation.
- **Resilience:** Replication mechanisms must tolerate node outages and network partitions.
- **Scalability:** Distribution procedures need to scale with network growth without compromising performance.
- **Security:** Transport of ledger data is protected to prevent tampering or leakage.
- **Auditability:** Replication components expose status APIs and record activity for forensic review.
- **Observability:** Health metrics and replication progress are surfaced for monitoring systems.

## Core Replication Components
### Ledger with Write-Ahead Logging
The ledger persists every block to an optional write-ahead log (WAL). Nodes replay this log on startup to recover previous state before accepting new blocks, forming the foundation for deterministic replication. WAL replay occurs automatically when a path is supplied and appends every committed block for crash-safe durability【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L49】【F:core/ledger.go†L52-L84】.

### Replicator Service
A dedicated **Replicator** module propagates newly committed blocks to peers. The service exposes start/stop/status controls and tracks which block hashes were dispatched, allowing downstream tooling to query replication progress or diagnose gaps【F:core/replication.go†L5-L49】.

### Synchronization Manager
The **SyncManager** coordinates block retrieval and verification. It exposes lifecycle hooks and a one-shot `Once` routine that samples the ledger head and records the last synchronized height, ensuring lagging nodes catch up with the network after restarts or network partitions【F:core/blockchain_synchronization.go†L8-L53】.

### Initialization Service
For new or recovering nodes, an **InitService** wrapper boots the ledger and engages the replicator. The service guards concurrent start/stop calls and orchestrates replication startup, enabling automated bootstrap procedures in deployment scripts and command‑line workflows【F:core/initialization_replication.go†L5-L37】.

## Distribution and State Management
### Compressed Snapshots
To expedite state transfers, nodes can generate compressed ledger snapshots. These gzip archives serialize balances, block history, UTXOs, and mempool contents for efficient transport or archival. Helpers exist to compress, persist, and later load these snapshots for migrations or audits【F:core/blockchain_compression.go†L20-L84】.

### Backup and Restore Utilities
Operational scripts support off-chain backups. A provided `backup_ledger.sh` utility packages the ledger directory into timestamped archives, simplifying disaster recovery and migration strategies by emitting portable tarballs【F:scripts/backup_ledger.sh†L1-L40】.

### Secure Channel Propagation
Replication traffic can be routed through **Zero-Trust Data Channels**, which encrypt payloads and sign messages. Channels maintain per‑peer keys, append signed message logs, and verify signatures before decryption, defending against spoofing or tampering【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L114】.

### Dataset Distribution Registry
Beyond block propagation, the network tracks which nodes host ancillary datasets. A **DataDistribution** registry records offerings and hosting locations, enabling clients to locate content without centralized indexes and to revoke stale records when nodes depart【F:data_distribution.go†L5-L71】.

## Enterprise Resilience
### High Availability Failover
Critical deployments can pair replication with a **FailoverManager** that tracks node heartbeats and promotes backups when primaries lapse, preserving service continuity across outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

### Monitoring and Audit
A **SystemHealthLogger** collects runtime metrics—goroutines, memory usage, peer counts, and block height—and exposes snapshots for dashboards or alerting. Coupled with replication status reports, operators gain visibility into network health and replication latency【F:system_health_logging.go†L10-L39】.

## Operational Guidelines
- Start the Replicator and SyncManager on node launch to participate fully in consensus.
- Schedule regular ledger backups and snapshot exports to external storage.
- Employ zero-trust channels for cross-organization replication or when traversing untrusted networks.
- Monitor dataset registry health to ensure content remains redundantly hosted.
- Integrate failover managers and health loggers to surface anomalies before they escalate.

## Conclusion
Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a comprehensive replication and distribution stack for the Synnergy Network. Through layered services, secure transport, and robust state management, the network sustains a consistent, recoverable ledger across a decentralized ecosystem.

## Ledger

# Ledger

## Introduction
Within the Synnergy network engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, the ledger is the canonical record of all value exchange and state transitions. It fuses block history, account balances, and unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) into a cohesive state machine that every service in the ecosystem relies upon.

## Architectural Overview
### Data Model
The ledger exposes a write‑ahead log (WAL) backed structure that persists blocks while tracking balances, UTXO sets, a mempool, and frozen accounts【F:core/ledger.go†L11-L33】. Each state mutation is gated by mutexes to guarantee thread‑safety across concurrent operations【F:core/ledger.go†L24-L33】.

### Block and Sub‑Block Flow
Transactions are first ordered into validator‑signed sub‑blocks before being aggregated into proof‑of‑work blocks, each linking to the previous hash to extend the chain【F:core/block.go†L10-L56】. Nodes mine these blocks and append them to their local ledger while distributing rewards and fees【F:core/node.go†L58-L93】.

### Transaction Schema and Validation
Transactions encapsulate sender and recipient addresses, value, fees, nonces, timestamps, optional biometric hashes, and executable programs for the Synnergy Virtual Machine【F:core/transaction.go†L12-L36】. Deterministic hashing and signature verification ensure integrity, while biometric attachments bind transactions to verified identities【F:core/transaction.go†L38-L95】.

## State Management
### Accounts, UTXOs, and Mempool
Balances and UTXO sets are updated atomically whenever credits, mints, transfers, or arbitrary transactions are applied. A dedicated mempool queues pending transactions for inclusion in subsequent blocks【F:core/ledger.go†L115-L186】.

### WAL, Snapshots, and Recovery
Blocks are appended to the chain and optionally written to a WAL. On restart the ledger replays the log to restore state, allowing nodes to recover without network assistance【F:core/ledger.go†L35-L84】.

### Snapshot Compression and Backup
Operators can checkpoint state by writing compressed snapshots and later restoring them. Built‑in helpers compress the ledger to a gzipped JSON representation and reload it on demand【F:core/blockchain_compression.go†L20-L83】. CLI subcommands allow saving and loading these snapshots for migration or audits【F:cli/compression.go†L23-L57】. For long‑term retention, a utility script packages the ledger directory into timestamped archives for off‑site backup【F:scripts/backup_ledger.sh†L1-L40】.

## Block Lifecycle and Consensus
Nodes package mempool contents into sub‑blocks, mine blocks, apply transactions to the ledger, and distribute fees proportionally to validators and miners. Stake is adjusted based on validator performance, enabling dynamic consensus weightings【F:core/node.go†L58-L93】.

## Replication and Synchronisation
A Replicator propagates newly mined blocks or snapshots to peers, while the Sync Manager coordinates download and verification to keep nodes aligned with the network head【F:core/replication.go†L5-L49】【F:core/blockchain_synchronization.go†L8-L53】.

## Indexing and Query Layer
For low‑latency access, an Indexing Node materialises ledger data into an in‑memory key/value store, supporting rapid queries and key enumeration for analytic services【F:indexing_node.go†L5-L61】.

## Sharding and Horizontal Scaling
A Shard Manager assigns leaders to shards, tracks cross‑shard receipts, and rebalances workloads when hot spots emerge, enabling horizontal growth of ledger capacity【F:core/sharding.go†L7-L95】. The CLI exposes subcommands for inspecting shard maps, submitting cross‑shard transaction headers, and increasing shard counts on demand【F:cli/sharding.go†L12-L113】.

## Cross‑Chain Interoperability
The bridge manager locks assets on the source chain and records transfer claims, using the ledger to debit senders and credit recipients once proofs are provided【F:core/cross_chain_bridge.go†L9-L144】.

## Zero‑Trust Channels and Escrow
Privacy‑sensitive workflows leverage a Zero Trust Engine that manages encrypted channels backed by ledger escrows. Messages are encrypted, signed, and verified to ensure confidentiality and authenticity【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L102】.

## Regulatory Oversight
A regulatory manager evaluates transactions against jurisdictional rules and flags violations, enabling regulator‑operated nodes to log and escalate suspicious activity【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L50】.

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery
Failover tooling monitors node heartbeats and promotes the most recent backup if a primary becomes unresponsive, keeping the ledger reachable through outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】. Combined with replication and snapshot backups, this provides enterprise‑grade resilience.

## Node Integration and CLI Tooling
Every network node embeds a ledger instance for transaction validation, stake accounting, and block creation【F:core/node.go†L8-L44】. Operators can inspect or manipulate state through a rich CLI, exposing commands for querying heads, blocks, balances, UTXO sets, the mempool, and for minting or transferring tokens【F:cli/ledger.go†L12-L113】.

## Security and Auditability
The genesis block is created during initialisation and safeguarded by an Immutability Enforcer that verifies its hash, preventing alteration of the chain’s origin【F:core/genesis_block.go†L19-L41】【F:core/immutability_enforcement.go†L5-L31】. Combined with deterministic hashing, signature checks, and mutex‑serialised mutations, the ledger offers a tamper‑evident foundation suitable for regulatory compliance and auditing.

## Future Enhancements
Planned research areas include adaptive sharding heuristics driven by real‑time telemetry, incremental snapshot pruning to reclaim disk space without downtime, and erasure‑coded replication streams to minimize bandwidth while preserving durability.

## Conclusion
The ledger is the heartbeat of the Synnergy network. By integrating persistent storage, rich transaction semantics, replication, cross‑chain hooks, and zero‑trust security controls, it enables **Blackridge Group Ltd.** to deliver a resilient and interoperable financial infrastructure for decentralised applications.

## Loanpool

# Loanpool

## Introduction
The Synnergy Network Loanpool is a branded treasury that allocates on‑chain capital to
community projects, small businesses, and infrastructure ventures. By embedding
compliance, voting, and disbursement logic directly in code, the Loanpool
provides transparent credit issuance and stimulates sustainable economic growth
across the ecosystem.

## Architecture Overview
Loanpool functionality is implemented in a set of core modules:

- **LoanPool** – maintains the pool’s treasury, proposal registry, and pause state
  for new submissions【F:core/loanpool.go†L9-L33】.
- **LoanProposal** – captures the details and voting state of a funding request【F:core/loanpool_proposal.go†L5-L17】.
- **LoanApplication** and **LoanPoolApply** – manage simplified loan applications
  backed by the same treasury【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L5-L46】.
- **LoanPoolManager** – offers administrative controls such as pausing submissions
  and summarising pool statistics【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L21-L43】.
- **View structures** – serialisable representations of proposals and applications
  for external clients and CLI tooling【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L52】【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L54-L97】.

## Treasury Mechanics
The pool is continuously capitalised through protocol fees. Five percent of every
transaction’s charges is routed into the Loanpool treasury, ensuring a growing
reserve for community credit initiatives【F:core/fees.go†L101-L123】. The canonical
treasury address is published in the VM’s opcode table so contracts can query the
current balance or perform on‑chain audits【F:core/opcode.go†L332-L339】.

## Proposal Lifecycle
The strategic flow of a Loanpool proposal is described in the Synnergy technical
whitepaper:

1. **Submission** – Applicants submit the recipient address, loan type, requested
   amount, collateral terms, and supporting documentation hashes.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L245-L249】
2. **Review Period** – A minimum review window allows the community to evaluate
   proposals before voting begins.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L250-L252】
3. **Voting Window** – Token holders vote with square‑root weighted power to avoid
   oligarchic dominance.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L253-L276】
4. **Authority Ratification** – Designated authority nodes perform compliance and
   risk checks; their votes are binding and publicly documented.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L255-L297】
5. **Disbursement** – Approved proposals release funds via timelocked contracts,
   locking collateral on‑chain and encoding milestone conditions.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L258-L260】
6. **Repayment & Reporting** – Automated repayments update borrower credit scores
   and enforce penalties for delinquencies.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L261-L263】

Within the codebase, proposals are voted on, evaluated, and disbursed through
methods such as `VoteProposal`, `Tick`, and `Disburse`, which ensure quorum
validation and treasury sufficiency before releasing funds【F:core/loanpool.go†L37-L75】.
Creators retain control over active requests: `CancelProposal` removes a proposal
that has not yet been disbursed, while `ExtendProposal` pushes the voting deadline
forward by a specified number of hours【F:core/loanpool.go†L93-L116】. Clients may
query individual items through `GetProposal` or obtain a sorted list with
`ListProposals`, which supports off‑chain indexing and audit trails【F:core/loanpool.go†L77-L91】.

## Loan Applications
For retail‑style borrowing the LoanPoolApply module allows direct applications.
Applications collect applicant identity, amount, term, and purpose, and are
approved once community votes exceed zero. Disbursement checks treasury balance
and application status before transferring funds【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L33-L81】.
CLI support is available through `synnergy loanpool_apply`, enabling submission,
voting, processing, disbursement, and inspection of applications【F:cli/loanpool_apply.go†L15-L88】.

## Loan and Grant Programs
The Loanpool supports multiple funding instruments tailored for different
stakeholders:

- **Repayable proposals** – capital‑intensive projects are submitted as
  `LoanProposal` records and must reach community quorum and authority
  ratification before disbursement【F:core/loanpool.go†L24-L75】.
- **Micro‑loans** – streamlined retail requests flow through
  `LoanPoolApply`, where a single affirmative vote is sufficient for approval,
  enabling rapid support for individuals and small businesses【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L5-L46】【F:core/loanpool_apply.go†L60-L81】.
- **Non‑repayable grants** – the SYN3800 grant registry tracks beneficiaries,
  caps, and release notes. Grants are created and disbursed through dedicated
  APIs and opcodes (`Loanpool_CreateGrant`, `Loanpool_ReleaseGrant`, and
  `Loanpool_GetGrant`) and can be administered from the `syn3800` CLI【F:core/syn3800.go†L8-L56】【F:core/opcode.go†L604-L620】【F:cli/syn3800.go†L14-L81】.

### Named Loan Contract Types
Each `LoanProposal` includes a free‑form `Type` field for labelling programmes such as infrastructure or education【F:core/loanpool_proposal.go†L5-L17】. Beyond these labels, the repository defines specialised loan contracts:

- **CollateralizedLoan** – secures borrowings against pledged assets to ensure principal protection before funds are released【F:smart-contracts/solidity/CollateralizedLoan.sol†L4-L6】.
- **UndercollateralizedLoan** – placeholder for credit‑based lending that accepts reduced collateral when borrowers meet off‑chain risk criteria【F:smart-contracts/solidity/UndercollateralizedLoan.sol†L4-L6】.
- **StableRateLoan** – anchors repayments to a fixed interest schedule, offering predictable liabilities regardless of market volatility【F:smart-contracts/solidity/StableRateLoan.sol†L4-L6】.
- **VariableRateLoan** – adjusts interest charges dynamically, allowing terms to track governance‑defined or oracle‑supplied benchmarks【F:smart-contracts/solidity/VariableRateLoan.sol†L4-L6】.
- **FlashLoan** – enables uncollateralised borrowing within a single transaction, requiring repayment before transaction completion to avoid reversal【F:smart-contracts/solidity/FlashLoan.sol†L4-L6】.
- **LoanAuction** – framework for market‑driven rate discovery where lenders bid to fund proposals, improving treasury utilisation【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanAuction.sol†L4-L6】.
- **LoanFactory** and **LoanRegistry** – scaffolding contracts for deploying standardised loan instances and cataloguing outstanding positions across the network【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanFactory.sol†L4-L6】【F:smart-contracts/solidity/LoanRegistry.sol†L4-L6】.

### Grant Contract Variants
Grant records leverage named categories for programme accounting. The SYN3800 registry stores beneficiary, category `Name`, total allocation, disbursed amount, and annotated release notes【F:core/syn3800.go†L8-L56】. The `Name` field labels grants—tests demonstrate a "research" award as a canonical example【F:core/syn3800_test.go†L5-L8】. Additional smart‑contract stubs outline specialised grant flows:

- **GrantTracker** – foundation for comprehensive on‑chain tracking of grant milestones and spending【F:smart-contracts/solidity/GrantTracker.sol†L4-L6】.
- **GrantMatching** – intended to pair community donations with approved proposals, enabling matched‑fund campaigns【F:smart-contracts/solidity/GrantMatching.sol†L4-L6】.
- **ScholarshipFund** – dedicated vehicle for education‑oriented grants and scholarship disbursements【F:smart-contracts/solidity/ScholarshipFund.sol†L4-L6】.

## State Serialisation and Views
Both proposals and applications expose JSON‑tagged view structs, allowing wallets
and dashboards to consume normalised metadata without direct access to internal
pointers. `LoanProposalView` mirrors the proposal fields and aggregates vote counts,
while `LoanApplicationView` reports applicant data and approval state【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L5-L33】【F:core/loanpool_views.go†L54-L78】.

## Administrative Controls
Authorities or designated operators can manage the Loanpool via the manager
interface. The `Pause` and `Resume` methods flip the pool’s global `Paused` flag to
halt or accept submissions, protecting the treasury during audits or emergency
conditions. `Stats` iterates across stored proposals to report counts of total,
approved, and disbursed items alongside the current treasury balance【F:core/loanpool_management.go†L21-L43】.
These capabilities are exposed to operators through `synnergy loanmgr` CLI
commands for pausing, resuming, and retrieving statistics【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L13-L41】.

## Authority Oversight and Voting
Authority nodes form a governance layer that validates Loanpool activity.
Candidates register with roles and accumulate one‑vote‑per‑address support from
network participants; the registry exposes methods to register, vote, sample
electorates, and verify membership【F:core/authority_nodes.go†L45-L98】. The VM
provides helper opcodes such as `Loanpool_RandomElectorate` and
`Loanpool_IsAuthority` so contracts can select oversight committees or enforce
authority‑only flows【F:core/opcode.go†L603-L610】. Operationally, the `synnergy
authority` CLI lets operators register nodes, cast votes, and sample electorates
for proposal due diligence【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L14-L52】.

## Smart Contract Opcodes
The Synnergy virtual machine exposes dedicated opcodes for Loanpool operations,
covering proposal submission, voting, treasury management, and application
processing. Core opcodes include `Loanpool_Submit`, `Loanpool_Vote`, `Loanpool_Tick`,
`Loanpool_CancelProposal`, and application‑level calls such as `LoanApply_Disburse`
and `LoanApply_List`. Additional opcodes cover grant management
(`Loanpool_CreateGrant`, `Loanpool_ReleaseGrant`, `Loanpool_GetGrant`) and
authority utilities (`Loanpool_RandomElectorate`, `Loanpool_IsAuthority`)【F:core/opcode.go†L598-L633】.

## Genesis Treasury
The genesis configuration assigns a dedicated wallet to the loan pool under the
`treasury_wallets.loan_pool` entry, ensuring initial funding and traceability for
all disbursements from network launch【F:configs/genesis.json†L4-L22】.

## Command‑Line Integration
The CLI suite offers comprehensive access to Loanpool features:

- `synnergy loanpool` manages proposal submission, voting, disbursement, and
  lifecycle actions such as ticking, listing, cancellation, and deadline
  extensions【F:cli/loanpool.go†L14-L120】.
- `synnergy loanpool_apply` handles application‑level operations from submission
  through disbursement, including voting, batch processing, and view retrieval【F:cli/loanpool_apply.go†L15-L88】.
- `synnergy loanmgr` provides administrative commands for pausing, resuming, and
  viewing statistics【F:cli/loanpool_management.go†L13-L41】.
- `synnergy loanproposal` offers tools for standalone proposal experimentation
  outside the main pool【F:cli/loanpool_proposal.go†L18-L95】.
- `synnergy authority` registers authority nodes, casts governance votes, and
  samples electorates for proposal oversight【F:cli/authority_nodes.go†L14-L52】.
- `syn3800` manages grant records, allowing creation, disbursement, inspection,
  and listing of SYN3800 grants【F:cli/syn3800.go†L14-L81】.
- A helper script simplifies submitting proposals from the command line
  (`cmd/scripts/loanpool_apply.sh`).【F:cmd/scripts/loanpool_apply.sh†L1-L10】

## Testing and Validation
Unit tests exercise the full lifecycle of proposals and applications, covering
submission, voting, approval, disbursement, and view serialisation. The
`TestLoanPoolProposalLifecycle` test ensures that both proposals and applications
transition through approval and disbursement correctly while updating treasury
totals and exposing accurate views【F:core/loanpool_test.go†L5-L42】.

## Risk Management and Bank Integration
Loan contracts integrate credit scoring and collateral valuation, while insurance
tokens such as SYN2800 life policies and SYN2900 general insurance can be attached
for programmatic claim processing【F:internal/tokens/syn2800.go†L10-L22】【F:internal/tokens/syn2900.go†L10-L23】.
Bank nodes interfacing with the Loanpool must maintain KYC records, report
performance metrics, and handle collateral liquidations, all under the oversight of
authority nodes that can freeze operations if risk thresholds are breached【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L312-L327】.

## Conclusion
Through a combination of deterministic smart‑contract logic, multi‑layered
governance, and rich tooling, the Loanpool stands as a flagship component of the
Synnergy Network’s branded financial infrastructure. It channels idle capital to
productive uses while upholding transparency, compliance, and community
participation.

## Maintenance

# Maintenance

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. treats maintenance as a continuous discipline that safeguards network reliability, security, and sustainability. Every node and service is designed with lifecycle controls so operators can apply updates, collect metrics, and retire resources without disrupting the broader ecosystem.

## Maintenance Principles at Blackridge Group Ltd.
1. **Proactivity** – anticipate failures through telemetry and predictive analysis.
2. **Security First** – apply zero‑trust design patterns and cryptographic verification for every maintenance action.
3. **Energy Awareness** – track efficiency and carbon offsets to maintain a sustainable footprint.
4. **Automated Recovery** – promote resilient architectures that recover without manual intervention.

## Proactive Node Monitoring
### System Health
Nodes expose runtime telemetry through the `SystemHealthLogger`, which captures CPU usage, memory consumption, peer count, and block height for external dashboards【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L34】. This snapshot interface enables real‑time diagnostics and capacity planning.

### High Availability & Failover
The `FailoverManager` tracks node heartbeats and automatically promotes a standby when the primary becomes unresponsive, ensuring continuity during maintenance windows or unexpected outages【F:high_availability.go†L8-L69】.

### Sustainability Tracking
`EnergyEfficientNode` instances record energy usage, accumulate offset credits, and issue sustainability certificates. Nodes can be throttled when efficiency falls below a configured threshold, aligning maintenance with environmental goals【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L8-L80】. Network operators also consult the `EnergyEfficiencyTracker` to calculate per‑validator and fleet‑wide transactions‑per‑kilowatt metrics, ensuring capacity upgrades target the least efficient segments first【F:energy_efficiency.go†L5-L58】.

### Watchtower Oversight
Distributed watchtower nodes observe peer behaviour, collect metrics, and surface fork events. Each node runs a dedicated firewall and health logger, allowing operators to investigate anomalies without interrupting production traffic【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L95】.

### Environmental Conditions
Edge deployments may attach sensors to track heat, humidity, or other site factors. The `EnvironmentalMonitoringNode` records threshold rules and triggers alerts when sensor data deviates, enabling pre‑emptive hardware maintenance in harsh environments【F:environmental_monitoring_node.go†L9-L64】.

## Secure and Resilient Operations
### Dynamic Consensus Windows
Administrators may override automatic heuristics with `SetMode` to pin the network to a specific consensus mechanism during upgrades. Evaluation routines consider live TPS, latency, and validator counts to restore optimal settings once maintenance is complete【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L43-L70】.

### Sandbox Lifecycle Management
Smart‑contract execution occurs within managed sandboxes. Operators can start, stop, reset, or delete individual sandboxes, freeing resources and isolating faults without affecting other workloads【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L105】.

### Zero‑Trust Data Channels
Maintenance communications rely on encrypted channels with signature verification. `ZeroTrustEngine` instances create, send over, and eventually close secure channels, preventing tampering and limiting exposure after tasks conclude【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L113】.

### Adaptive Firewall Rules
Every maintenance window includes a review of live firewall policies. Administrators can block wallets, tokens, or IP ranges in real time, ensuring vulnerable endpoints are isolated before upgrades proceed【F:firewall.go†L5-L103】.

### Privileged Access Controls
Role‑based permissions restrict maintenance tooling to vetted personnel. The `AccessController` grants or revokes roles for addresses, enabling granular delegation of operational duties【F:access_control.go†L5-L63】. For highly sensitive actions, a `BiometricSecurityNode` requires biometric proof and signature validation before executing privileged functions, preventing credential reuse or session hijacking【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L45】.

## AI‑Assisted Predictive Maintenance
AI models monitor their own performance through `DriftMonitor`, comparing live metrics against established baselines. Detected drift signals the need for retraining or model replacement before accuracy degrades, supporting proactive maintenance of intelligent subsystems【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L35】.

### Streaming Anomaly Detection
Operational telemetry feeds into a lightweight `AnomalyDetector` that maintains rolling statistics and flags outliers. Sudden spikes in latency or memory usage raise alerts, giving engineers time to remediate issues before they escalate【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## Governance and Regulatory Oversight
Regulatory managers catalogue jurisdiction‑specific rules and evaluate transactions for violations, while regulator‑operated nodes flag suspicious addresses and retain immutable audit logs. These components embed compliance directly into routine maintenance workflows【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L44】.

## Operational Workflow
1. **Monitor:** aggregate system metrics and sustainability data.
2. **Plan:** schedule upgrades using consensus overrides and failover routing to minimize disruption.
3. **Execute:** apply patches or configuration changes within isolated sandboxes and encrypted channels.
4. **Verify:** run health checks and snapshot audits to confirm stability.
5. **Report:** archive metrics and sustainability certificates for compliance.

## Reporting and Compliance
Maintenance activities generate auditable artifacts—health snapshots, failover events, energy certificates, anomaly flags, and regulatory logs—that feed governance dashboards and statutory disclosures. This transparency upholds Blackridge Group Ltd.’s commitment to accountable infrastructure management.

## Audit Trails & Forensic Logging
`SystemHealthLogger` snapshots and regulatory node flags are retained for long‑term forensics, allowing investigators to reconstruct incident timelines and verify remediation steps【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L47】【F:regulatory_node.go†L35-L49】.

## Conclusion
By weaving proactive monitoring, secure automation, and sustainability into every layer, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a maintenance framework that keeps the Synnergy Network dependable and future‑ready. Operators can service the network confidently, knowing critical functions remain resilient throughout each maintenance cycle.

## Mathematical Algorithms

# Mathematical Algorithms

## Introduction
As part of the Synnergy Network developed by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, mathematical algorithms form the backbone of our secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain ecosystem. This document details the core algorithms implemented throughout the codebase, highlighting how they underpin cryptographic security, consensus, analytics, and data privacy across the platform.

## Cryptographic Foundations
Robust cryptography ensures that every transaction and message on the Synnergy Network is verifiable and tamper resistant.

### Hashing with SHA-256
SHA-256 is employed to derive unique identifiers and to fingerprint critical data structures. For example, bridge identifiers in our cross-chain manager are generated by hashing the concatenation of source chain, target chain, and a timestamp【F:cross_chain.go†L33-L49】.

**Formula**

\[
  H(x) = \mathrm{SHA256}(x)
\]

Bridge identifiers use

\[
  \text{id} = \mathrm{SHA256}(\text{source} \Vert "|" \Vert \text{target} \Vert "|" \Vert t)
\]

where \(t\) is a nanosecond timestamp. The 256‑bit digest ensures collision resistance for cross‑chain operations.

### Symmetric Encryption via AES-GCM
Private data channels and confidential transactions are protected using AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). The `Encrypt` utility wraps payloads in authenticated encryption, producing `nonce||ciphertext` outputs for secure storage and transport【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L45】.

**Algorithm**

1. Generate a random nonce \(N\).
2. Compute \(C = \mathrm{AES\text{-}GCM}_{K}(N, P)\) for key \(K\) and plaintext \(P\).
3. Persist \(N \Vert C\) so the nonce accompanies the ciphertext.

Decryption splits \(N\) and \(C\) and applies \(P = \mathrm{AES\text{-}GCM\_Dec}_{K}(N, C)\), verifying the authentication tag before releasing the plaintext.

### Digital Signatures
Two signature schemes operate within the network:
- **Ed25519** signatures secure zero-trust data channels. Messages are signed before distribution and verified upon receipt to guard against tampering【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L50-L97】.
- **ECDSA** is used for biometric authentication, binding hashed biometric templates to user addresses and verifying access requests【F:biometrics_auth.go†L1-L45】.

**Signature Flow**

For a message \(m\):

- Ed25519: \( \sigma = \mathrm{Sign}_{\text{Ed25519}}(sk, m)\) and verification checks \( \mathrm{Verify}_{\text{Ed25519}}(pk, m, \sigma)\).
- ECDSA: \( \sigma = \mathrm{Sign}_{\text{ECDSA}}(sk, H(m))\) with \(H\) being SHA‑256; verification ensures \( \mathrm{Verify}_{\text{ECDSA}}(pk, H(m), \sigma)\).

## Consensus and Network Control
Efficient consensus algorithms maintain network integrity while balancing throughput and decentralization.

### Dynamic Consensus Hopping
The `ConsensusHopper` algorithm evaluates real-time metrics—transactions per second, latency, and validator count—to switch among Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and Proof-of-History modes. This adaptive approach optimizes performance without sacrificing security【F:dynamic_consensus_hopping.go†L57-L71】.

**Heuristic**

\[
\text{mode} =
\begin{cases}
 \text{PoS}, & \text{if } \text{TPS} > 1000 \land \text{Latency} < 1 \\
 \text{PoH}, & \text{if } \text{Validators} < 10 \\
 \text{PoW}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### Cross-Chain Bridge Identification
Cross-chain interoperability relies on deterministic identifiers for bridges. By hashing chain parameters with SHA-256, the manager guarantees collision-resistant IDs, ensuring consistent referencing across distributed components【F:cross_chain.go†L33-L49】.

## Economic Mechanics
Economic incentives on the Synnergy Network are governed by deterministic fee and stake algorithms that promote fair resource allocation.

### Transaction Fee Computation
Base fees use the median of the last 1,000 block fees scaled by a network load factor \(\alpha\). Variable and priority components add proportional costs and user tips【F:core/fees.go†L28-L60】.

\[
F_{\text{base}} = \operatorname{median}(f_{\text{recent}}) \cdot (1+\alpha), \qquad F_{\text{var}} = U \times P, \qquad F_{\text{prio}} = T, \quad F_{\text{total}} = F_{\text{base}} + F_{\text{var}} + F_{\text{prio}}
\]

### Fee Distribution
Total fees are allocated across network participants according to predefined percentages, ensuring sustainable funding for development, charity, and validator incentives【F:core/fees.go†L101-L127】.

\[
\text{Validators/Miners}=64\%,\; \text{Internal Dev}=5\%,\; \text{Internal Charity}=5\%,\; \text{External Charity}=5\%,\; \text{Loan Pool}=5\%,\; \text{Passive Income}=5\%,\; \text{Authority Nodes}=5\%,\; \text{Node Hosts}=5\%,\; \text{Creator}=1\%
\]

Fees can be capped or floored through policy parameters, adjusting as \(F' = \min(\max(F, \text{floor}), \text{cap})\), while load-based multipliers tune base and variable rates for congestion control【F:core/fees.go†L130-L169】.

### Transaction Ordering Optimization
Optimization nodes reorder pending transactions by fee density to maximize throughput. Each transaction's density is computed as \(d_i = \frac{\text{fee}_i}{\text{size}_i}\); the queue is sorted in descending order of \(d_i\) before block assembly【F:internal/nodes/optimization_nodes/optimization.go†L17-L45】.

### Stake Penalty Enforcement
Validator misbehavior accrues penalty points. Stake adjustments follow \(s' = \max(0, s + \Delta)\), while penalties update \(p' = p + k\) with reason and timestamp recorded for auditability【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L53】.

## Virtual Machine Execution
Contract bytecode runs inside a `SimpleVM` that interprets 24-bit opcodes and charges one unit of gas per instruction.

### Opcode Interpretation and Gas Accounting
For bytecode of length \(L\), the VM calculates

\[
\text{opCount} = \left\lceil\frac{L}{3}\right\rceil,\qquad \text{gasUsed} = \max(1, \text{opCount}).
\]

Execution halts if \(\text{gasUsed} > \text{gasLimit}\). Each opcode is extracted as \(b_0 \ll 16 \mid b_1 \ll 8 \mid b_2\) and dispatched to its registered handler, while a concurrency limiter bounds parallel executions according to the VM profile【F:virtual_machine.go†L121-L178】.

## Data Integrity and Privacy
Ensuring confidentiality and authenticity of data flows is central to Blackridge's zero-trust philosophy.

### Zero-Trust Data Channels
The `ZeroTrustEngine` orchestrates encrypted channels that pair symmetric AES encryption with Ed25519 signatures. Each message is sealed and signed, and verification occurs before decryption, providing defense-in-depth against interception and forgery【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L35-L102】.

**Message Lifecycle**

1. Encrypt payload \(P\) with key \(K\): \(C = \mathrm{AES\text{-}GCM}_{K}(N, P)\).
2. Sign ciphertext: \(\sigma = \mathrm{Sign}_{\text{Ed25519}}(sk, C)\).
3. Store \((C, \sigma)\); recipients verify and decrypt using \(pk\) and \(K\).

### Private Transactions
Confidential transactions leverage the AES-GCM `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` routines to protect payloads while preserving integrity. The `PrivateTxManager` stores encrypted entries and exposes a controlled interface for retrieval, enabling selective disclosure on the ledger【F:private_transactions.go†L11-L77】.

Given key \(K\) and plaintext \(P\), a unique nonce \(N\) yields \(C = \mathrm{AES\text{-}GCM}_{K}(N, P)\). Decryption recomputes \(P = \mathrm{AES\text{-}GCM\_Dec}_{K}(N, C)\) ensuring confidentiality and authenticity of private ledger entries.

### Holographic Data Sharding
To increase resiliency, `SplitHolographic` partitions data \(D\) into \(n\) shards of size

\[
s = \left\lceil \frac{|D|}{n} \right\rceil.
\]

Shard \(i\) copies bytes from \(i s\) to \((i+1)s\). `ReconstructHolographic` concatenates shards in order to reassemble \(D\)【F:holographic.go†L9-L37】.

## Intelligent Analytics
Machine learning and statistical models provide proactive security and forecasting capabilities.

### Streaming Anomaly Detection
The `AnomalyDetector` implements an online mean and variance tracker using Welford's method. Each observation updates running statistics, and z-score thresholds flag deviations indicative of fraudulent or malfunctioning behavior【F:anomaly_detection.go†L27-L49】.

**Update Equations**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\delta &= x - \mu_{n-1} \\
\mu_n &= \mu_{n-1} + \frac{\delta}{n} \\
M2_n &= M2_{n-1} + \delta (x - \mu_n) \\
\sigma^2 &= \frac{M2_n}{n-1}
\end{aligned}
\]

The z‑score \( z = \frac{|x - \mu_n|}{\sigma} \) is anomalous when \( z > \text{threshold} \).

### Financial Prediction Models
Financial modules include multiple forecasting strategies:
- **Moving Average** smooths volatility by averaging recent price windows.
- **Linear Regression** fits a least-squares line to historical prices.
- **AR(1) Autoregression** estimates future values from immediate history.
A unified `ForecastSeries` helper selects and executes the appropriate model, enabling flexible market analysis【F:financial_prediction.go†L12-L108】.

**Formulations**

- Moving Average:
  \[
  \hat{x}_{t+1} = \frac{1}{w} \sum_{i=t-w+1}^{t} x_i
  \]
- Linear Regression:
  \[
  b = \frac{n\sum xy - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{n\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2},\qquad
  a = \frac{\sum y - b\sum x}{n},\qquad
  \hat{y} = a + b x
  \]
- AR(1):
  \[
  \phi = \frac{\sum x_{t-1} x_t}{\sum x_{t-1}^2},\qquad \hat{x}_{t+1} = \phi x_t
  \]

### Fraud Risk Inference
The `InferenceEngine` loads deterministic models and computes fraud scores for transactions by hashing identifiers with SHA-256. The resulting probability distribution aids in automated risk assessment across batches of transactions【F:ai_inference_analysis.go†L33-L54】.

Fraud score for transaction identifier \(i\) is calculated as

\[
\text{score}(i) = \frac{\mathrm{SHA256}(i)_0}{255}
\]

where \(\mathrm{SHA256}(i)_0\) denotes the first byte of the hash interpreted as an integer.

### Model Drift Monitoring
To ensure deployed machine-learning models remain reliable, the `DriftMonitor` tracks performance metrics against stored baselines and raises alerts when deviation exceeds a tolerance【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L19-L34】.

**Drift Condition**

\[
\text{drift}(m) = \bigl|M_m - B_m\bigr| > \theta
\]

where \(M_m\) is the latest metric for model \(m\), \(B_m\) is its baseline, and \(\theta\) is an acceptable deviation threshold. Exceeding the threshold signals potential model degradation requiring retraining.

## Sustainability and Resource Optimization
Resource-aware algorithms optimize network operations to minimize environmental impact and preserve device longevity.

### Energy Efficiency Tracking
Validators record throughput and energy consumption through the `EnergyEfficiencyTracker`, producing an efficiency score in transactions per kilowatt-hour and issuing sustainability certificates【F:energy_efficiency.go†L17-L57】【F:energy_efficient_node.go†L52-L64】.

**Efficiency Metrics**

\[
\eta_v = \frac{T_v}{E_v},\qquad
\bar{\eta} = \frac{\sum_v T_v}{\sum_v E_v}
\]

where \(T_v\) and \(E_v\) denote transactions processed and energy consumed by validator \(v\), respectively, and \(\bar{\eta}\) is the network-wide average. Certificates embed \(\eta_v\) along with accumulated carbon-offset credits.

### Battery-Aware Mining
Mobile miners incorporate power-aware logic, pausing work when battery reserves fall below a defined threshold to avoid device exhaustion【F:mobile_mining_node.go†L24-L42】.

**Mining Policy**

\[
\text{mine} =
\begin{cases}
\text{start}, & b \ge \tau \\
\text{stop}, & b < \tau
\end{cases}
\]

where \(b\) is the current battery level and \(\tau\) is the minimum level required for mining.

## Identity and Access Management
Blackridge Group Ltd. enforces strong identity controls with registries, audit logs, and role-based permissions.

### ID Wallet Registration
The `IDRegistry` maps wallet addresses to metadata and rejects duplicate entries, enabling constant-time lookups and registration checks【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】.

### Identity Verification Logs
`IdentityService` stores personal metadata and appends timestamped records for each verification attempt, creating an auditable trail of methods used【F:identity_verification.go†L9-L56】.

### Role-Based Access Control
An `AccessController` associates each address with a set of roles. Granting inserts a role, revocation removes it, and access checks test membership:

\[
\mathrm{HasRole}(r, a) \iff r \in R_a
\]

where \(R_a\) is the role set for address \(a\)【F:access_control.go†L5-L47】.

### Biometric Verification
Biometric enrollment stores SHA-256 hashes of user templates alongside corresponding ECDSA public keys. Verification recomputes the hash and checks an ECDSA signature, ensuring that only authorized biometric data unlocks protected services【F:biometrics_auth.go†L25-L45】.

**Verification Steps**

1. Compute \(h = \mathrm{SHA256}(b)\) for submitted biometric \(b\).
2. Confirm \(h = h_{\text{stored}}\).
3. Validate \( \mathrm{Verify}_{\text{ECDSA}}(pk, h, \sigma)\) for signature \(\sigma\).

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network’s strength derives from its rigorous mathematical underpinnings. By integrating vetted cryptographic primitives, adaptive consensus control, and intelligent analytics, **Blackridge Group Ltd.** delivers a blockchain platform that is secure, scalable, and ready for the future of decentralized applications.

## Network

# Network

## Overview
Blackridge Group Ltd. operates the Synnergy Network, an extensible blockchain infrastructure where heterogeneous nodes exchange data through a biometric‑aware communication layer. The network service manages peer discovery, transaction routing and a lightweight pub‑sub bus while providing life‑cycle controls to other components and the command line.

## Architecture
The `Network` struct coordinates standard nodes and relay nodes. It maintains a broadcast queue, biometric authentication service and subscriber registry, launching a background processing loop on creation so that transaction propagation begins immediately.

### Asynchronous Propagation
Transactions are first enqueued and then fanned out to every known peer. `Broadcast` attaches biometric credentials before queuing, ensuring that only authorised traffic is relayed. The processing loop pulls from the queue and distributes transactions across nodes and relays. This design decouples submission from propagation, enabling high throughput without blocking callers.

### Pub‑Sub Messaging
Beyond transaction flow, the network exposes topic‑based messaging. Subscribers receive independent buffered channels and publishers can disseminate arbitrary payloads on a best‑effort basis. These hooks underpin real‑time telemetry and cross‑module communication.

### Lifecycle Management
`Start` spins up background workers, allocates the broadcast queue and begins processing immediately, while `Stop` gracefully drains outstanding transactions before releasing resources. These controls allow orchestration tools and the CLI to restart networking services without node restarts.

### Relay Coordination
Relay nodes extend propagation beyond directly connected peers. The network tracks relays separately, fanning transactions to them in the same loop used for standard nodes so that geographically distributed segments remain synchronised even under partitioned conditions.

### Adaptive Consensus
The network samples throughput, latency and validator participation to dynamically select the most appropriate consensus model. A consensus hopper evaluates these metrics and pivots between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake or proof‑of‑history modes so that the system maintains performance as conditions change.

## Node Ecosystem
### Core Nodes
Every node maintains a ledger, consensus engine, virtual machine and mempool while tracking stakes and slashing status for governance. They expose transaction queues and peer lists so that validators, clients and auxiliary services interact through a uniform interface.

### Content Nodes
Content network nodes advertise which digital assets they host, allowing participants to discover resources through a simple registry and to add or remove items as availability changes. This lightweight catalogue supports decentralised storage and content distribution without central servers.

### Indexing Nodes
Indexing nodes build in‑memory key/value indices to accelerate queries against ledger data. They support insert, query, delete and enumeration operations for rapid look‑ups, enabling analytics services to scan large block ranges without replaying the entire chain.

### Mining Nodes
Lightweight mining nodes simulate proof‑of‑work by generating block candidates at a configurable hash rate and submitting mined blocks back to the network. The abstraction is intentionally simple so that testnets and development environments can exercise block production without specialised hardware.

### Regulatory Nodes
Regulatory nodes evaluate transactions against registered rules, flagging entities when violations occur and maintaining auditable logs for compliance reviews. Each node records the reason for every flag, building a tamper‑evident trail for regulators and auditors.

### Watchtower Nodes
Watchtower nodes monitor system health and detect forks. They collect metrics, run firewall checks and report anomalies to operators. Background routines emit periodic snapshots that external dashboards or alerting systems can consume.

### Staking Nodes
Staking nodes track token commitments from participants, expose balances and aggregate totals for reward calculations. They support stake and unstake operations without requiring a full ledger implementation and can be embedded into wallets or lightweight clients.

### Energy‑Efficient Nodes
Energy‑efficient nodes record transaction volume against electricity usage, issue sustainability certificates and monitor whether validators fall below configured efficiency thresholds. Certificates capture transactions per kilowatt‑hour and accumulated carbon offsets, allowing validators to demonstrate sustainable operations.

### Environmental Monitoring Nodes
Environmental monitoring nodes ingest sensor data and trigger programmable conditions, enabling on‑chain actions when external environmental thresholds are met. Conditions describe operators, thresholds and sensor identifiers so that policy logic can be adjusted without redeploying code.

### Geospatial Nodes
Geospatial nodes collect location records for subjects, building immutable histories of movement that other services can query for audits or asset tracking. Each record stores coordinates with a trusted timestamp to ensure evidentiary integrity.

## Network Management Interface
A dedicated CLI command suite starts or stops services, lists peers and exposes simple publish/subscribe helpers. Operators can broadcast messages or tail topics directly from the terminal for diagnostics and orchestration tasks, and ancillary commands surface address parsing, gas snapshot retrieval and other utilities so that all operational workflows are scriptable.

## Testing Harness
Stage 46 introduces an end‑to‑end harness that launches the wallet server, builds an in‑memory network with biometric authentication, creates wallets via HTTP and verifies transaction propagation across nodes. The harness also exercises CLI functionality such as address parsing and gas snapshot retrieval to ensure seamless component interoperability and to validate that consensus hopping and pub‑sub channels behave as expected under load.

## Security
Biometric verification is woven into the broadcast path, preventing unauthorised transactions from entering the network. Watchtower nodes log fork events and performance metrics, while regulatory nodes enforce jurisdictional policies, giving infrastructure operators visibility and control.

### Firewall Enforcement
An embedded firewall maintains block lists for wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs. Rules can be added or revoked at runtime, letting operators react to abuse without downtime.

### Zero‑Trust Channels
Zero‑trust data channels encrypt payloads with per‑channel keys and sign each cipher text using Ed25519 keys. Messages are stored as signed envelopes and are verified and decrypted on receipt, assuring confidentiality and provenance for inter‑service communication.

### Monitoring and Health Logging
A lightweight health logger records memory usage, peer counts and block height alongside a timestamp. Metrics are periodically emitted to watchtower nodes, allowing dashboards or external systems to consume near real‑time telemetry for capacity planning and incident response.

## Compliance and Governance
Regulatory nodes integrate with a configurable rule engine that validates transactions before they propagate. Flagged entities are recorded with reasons, forming an immutable audit log. Governance policies can be adjusted by updating rule definitions, enabling jurisdictions to enforce local requirements without altering core consensus.

## Scalability and Interoperability
Relay nodes extend propagation and redundancy, and the pub‑sub layer supports auxiliary protocols. A consensus hopper scales throughput by shifting consensus modes when network conditions fluctuate. Cross‑chain managers maintain long‑lived links to external ledgers and assign deterministic bridge identifiers, while bridge managers coordinate token transfers with verifiable proofs and authorized relayers, positioning the platform for heterogeneous blockchain domains.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Network by Blackridge Group Ltd. combines secure transaction routing, flexible messaging and a diverse node ecosystem to provide a resilient foundation for distributed applications. Its automated testing harness and CLI tooling streamline operations, while specialised nodes offer governance, compliance and monitoring capabilities for enterprise‑grade deployments.

## Nodes

# Nodes

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, is built upon a
versatile node ecosystem. Nodes are distributed software agents that validate
transactions, maintain ledger state, enforce compliance, and surface network
intelligence. The architecture emphasizes modularity so that each node type can
be deployed independently or combined to serve bespoke operational roles.

## Core Node Architecture
Every node instance embeds several core subsystems:

- **Ledger Interface** – provides account balance and state management.
- **Synnergy Consensus** – selects validators and validates sub‑blocks before
  they are committed to the blockchain.
- **SNVM Virtual Machine** – executes smart‑contract opcodes in a sandboxed
  environment.
- **Mempool and Blockchain Stores** – track pending transactions and confirmed
  blocks.
- **Stake and Slashing Registry** – records validator stakes and enforces
  penalties for double‑signing or downtime.

These components allow a node to accept transactions, validate them against the
ledger, bundle them into sub‑blocks, and mine canonical blocks when consensus is
achieved.

## Node Classifications
Synnergy supports a broad spectrum of specialized nodes. The following
subsections summarize the primary classes available in the reference
implementation.

### Validator Nodes
Validator nodes extend the base node with validator management and quorum
tracking. They enforce minimum stake requirements, track validator membership,
and determine whether a quorum has been reached before new blocks are accepted.

### Mining Nodes
Mining nodes simulate proof‑of‑work behavior. They iterate at a configured hash
rate, generate candidate block hashes, and submit mined blocks back to the
network. A variant designed for battery‑powered devices, the **Mobile Mining
Node**, halts hashing automatically when battery levels fall below a
configurable threshold.

### Staking Nodes
Staking nodes maintain token stakes for multiple participants. They expose
interfaces to stake, unstake, and query balances, enabling lightweight staking
experiments without a full ledger implementation.

### Indexing Nodes
Indexing nodes build in‑memory key/value indices over ledger data to enable
rapid queries. They offer CRUD‑like semantics so that other services can query
state snapshots efficiently.

### Content Network Nodes
Content nodes register the availability of content items and expose metadata so
peers can discover hosted assets. They underpin distributed content delivery and
replication strategies across the network.

### Regulatory Nodes
Regulatory nodes integrate with `RegulatoryManager` services to evaluate
transactions against jurisdictional rules. When violations are detected, the
node records flags against offending addresses, supporting audit trails and
real‑time enforcement.

### Watchtower Nodes
Watchtower nodes monitor the network for forks and health anomalies. They
include a firewall, system health logger, and pluggable metrics exporter. These
nodes periodically collect telemetry and can report fork events for downstream
mitigation.

### Energy‑Efficient Nodes
Energy‑efficient nodes track transaction throughput relative to power
consumption and maintain sustainability certificates. They also allow operators
to assign carbon offset credits and determine when throttling is required to
meet efficiency targets.

### Environmental Monitoring Nodes
Environmental monitoring nodes ingest sensor data and evaluate it against
registered conditions. They can trigger automated actions—such as pausing
operations—when thresholds are exceeded.

### Geospatial Nodes
Geospatial nodes record latitude and longitude data for tracked subjects and
provide historical lookups. They enable use cases that rely on location
awareness and provenance tracking.

### Biometric Security Nodes
Biometric security nodes pair node identities with biometric authentication.
Privileged operations are gated behind biometric verification, delivering an
additional security layer for high‑risk workflows.

### Warfare Nodes
Warfare nodes extend the base node for military logistics. They securely record
logistics entries, process privileged commands after validation, and provide
hooks for sharing tactical information across secure channels.

### Forensic Nodes
Forensic nodes capture minimal `TransactionLite` records and granular network
traces so operators can reconstruct events during incident response and satisfy
evidentiary requirements.

### Historical Nodes
Historical nodes archive concise `BlockSummary` metadata and offer lookup
interfaces by height or hash, serving long‑term chain explorers and reducing the
load on production ledgers.

### Holographic Nodes
Holographic nodes distribute redundant `HolographicFrame` data across peers,
allowing critical state to be reconstituted even if portions of the network are
lost.

### Optimization Nodes
Optimization nodes analyse runtime metrics and emit scaling suggestions so that
orchestration layers can proactively right‑size compute and storage resources.

## Advanced Runtime Services
Beyond the role‑specific functionality, Synnergy nodes embed a collection of
enterprise‑grade services that harden runtime behavior and streamline
operations:

- **Firewall and Access Control** – concurrency‑safe block lists prevent
  interaction with sanctioned wallet addresses, token identifiers, or peer IPs,
  minimizing attack surface.
- **System Health Logging** – background routines collect CPU usage, memory
  allocation, peer counts, and last‑block height so operators can surface
  telemetry in dashboards or trigger alerts.
- **Zero‑Trust Data Channels** – encrypted, signature‑verified channels allow
  nodes to exchange sensitive payloads without assuming network trust,
  supporting verifiable off‑chain messaging and custody workflows.
- **Sandboxed Contract Execution** – a sandbox manager instantiates isolated
  virtual machines with gas and memory limits, enabling deterministic contract
  execution and rapid environment resets.
- **Dynamic Consensus Hopping** – nodes can evaluate throughput, latency, and
  validator counts to switch between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake, or
  proof‑of‑history consensus modes in real time.
- **Anomaly Detection** – streaming statistical models highlight deviations in
  runtime metrics, providing an early warning system for denial‑of‑service or
  misconfiguration events.
- **Identity Verification** – a ledger‑integrated `IdentityService` stores
  address metadata and verification logs to satisfy KYC and AML mandates.
- **Cross‑Chain Bridge Management** – a `CrossChainManager` registers bridge
  configurations and whitelists authorized relayers for controlled asset
  transfers.
- **Forensic and Historical Logging** – optional subsystems capture
  `TransactionLite` entries and block summaries to maintain audit‑ready evidence
  trails.
- **Resource Optimization Hooks** – optimization modules evaluate CPU, memory,
  latency, and throughput to produce autoscaling recommendations.

## Enterprise Deployment and Operations
Blackridge Group Ltd. curates a full operations toolchain so organizations can
run nodes at scale:

- **High Availability** – nodes are shipped as container images with
  Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible manifests that support rolling upgrades and
  multi‑region failover.
- **Observability** – watchtower and system‑health components export metrics
  compatible with common monitoring stacks, while audit logs from regulatory
  and security modules integrate with SIEM platforms.
- **Governance and Compliance** – integration hooks allow nodes to enforce
  jurisdiction‑specific regulations, attach biometric requirements to privileged
  operations, and maintain carbon‑offset certificates for sustainability
  reporting.
- **Cross‑Chain and Private Connectivity** – nodes can bridge assets and data to
  external networks or leverage zero‑trust channels for private off‑chain
  coordination without compromising ledger integrity.
- **Resource Optimization** – optimization nodes feed utilization metrics into
  autoscaling policies so clusters adjust capacity before performance degrades.

## Node Lifecycle and Optimization
Nodes expose start and stop hooks for controlled rollouts, while the sandbox
manager enables deterministic resets of contract environments. System health
metrics gathered from runtime logging can be fed into optimization modules,
which analyse resource usage and recommend scaling actions to meet service‑level
objectives.

## Interconnectivity and Communication
All nodes use authenticated channels and can be fronted by a built‑in firewall
component. Zero‑trust data channels overlay existing RPC to protect sensitive
payloads. Indexing and content nodes may expose additional APIs for external
clients, while watchtower and regulatory nodes feed analytics and compliance
systems. Cross‑chain adapters enable selected nodes to interact with external
blockchains when required.

## Security and Compliance
Security is multi‑layered: biometric authentication prevents unauthorized
access, watchtower nodes surface anomalies, and regulatory nodes enforce
jurisdictional policy. The slashing registry protects consensus integrity by
penalizing malicious validators, while firewalls filter unwanted network
traffic. Identity services track verified addresses, cross‑chain bridges rely on
whitelisted relayers, and forensic and historical subsystems provide tamper‑
evident audit trails.

## Deployment and Maintenance
Blackridge Group Ltd. provides container images and infrastructure‑as‑code
artifacts for orchestrating nodes across on‑premises or cloud environments.
Operators should monitor system health metrics, schedule regular certificate
renewal for energy‑efficient nodes, rotate keys used in biometric and regulatory
subsystems, and prune forensic or archival logs in accordance with retention
policies.

## Economic Incentives
Validator and mining nodes earn rewards through block production and fee
distribution. Staking nodes support delegators with transparent balance queries,
while energy‑efficient nodes can monetize sustainability certificates within
green‑energy marketplaces.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy node framework empowers operators to tailor deployments to
specific roles—from lightweight indexing nodes to fully fledged validator or
regulatory instances. By combining modular subsystems with robust security and
compliance tooling, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers a flexible foundation for
next‑generation decentralized infrastructure.

## Opcodes and gas

# Opcodes and Gas

## Overview
At Blackridge Group Ltd., the Synnergy network executes every function through a deterministic opcode. Each opcode is a 24‑bit identifier that maps directly to a smart‑contract or system routine, allowing wallets and dashboards to reason about behaviour and cost before execution. Gas fees are priced centrally so that network actors share a consistent view of execution costs across releases.

## Opcode Encoding
Every instruction occupies three bytes. The high byte denotes the protocol category and the remaining two bytes form a sequential ordinal, yielding the canonical layout `0xCCNNNN`【F:core/opcode.go†L6-L8】. The dispatcher exposes helpers for converting these values to hexadecimal or raw bytecode and for validating inbound byte streams, ensuring tooling can safely serialise or parse opcodes【F:core/opcode.go†L1660-L1676】.

### Conversion Utilities
Synnergy ships multiple helpers to translate between human‑readable names and their binary representation. `ParseOpcode` converts a three‑byte slice into a numeric opcode and rejects malformed lengths, while `MustParseOpcode` provides a panic‑on‑error variant for tooling【F:core/opcode.go†L1675-L1690】. For outbound workflows, `ToBytecode` and `HexDump` expose canonical encodings so dashboards can embed opcodes directly in transactions or documentation. `DebugDump` offers a lexicographically sorted list of name‑to‑hex pairs for on‑chain auditing tools and CLI inspection【F:core/opcode.go†L1692-L1728】.

## Opcode Catalogue
### Synnergy Virtual Machine
The Synnergy Virtual Machine (SNVM) exposes a consolidated catalogue of opcodes. The catalogue is continually expanded to incorporate new modules—such as consensus, node management and cross‑chain flows—and assigns a stable code to each exported function【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L3-L15】.

#### Catalogue Coverage
`snvm._opcodes.go` enumerates every function compiled into the VM, spanning AI marketplaces, node orchestration, cross‑chain bridges and hundreds of token utilities. Each entry declares a descriptive identifier and its 24‑bit code so external systems can reason about capability coverage before execution【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L1-L16】.

### Normalisation and Registration
During initialisation the opcode catalogue is normalised. Sequential identifiers are generated per category and handlers are registered with the dispatcher, guaranteeing unique values at runtime. Once the catalogue is finalised, the gas table is constructed so that each opcode has an associated cost【F:core/opcode.go†L1624-L1653】.

### Module Constants
Critical opcodes are exposed as variables so dependants can reference stable values without embedding magic numbers. `contracts_opcodes.go` resolves contract‑management operations—such as deployment and pause/resume—through the catalogue at start‑up, panicking if a name is missing to catch mismatches during CI【F:core/contracts_opcodes.go†L1-L24】.

### Catalogue Introspection
The dispatcher publishes the full mapping for external auditors. `Catalogue` returns a slice of opcodes with their current gas price, while `Opcodes` exposes a map of numeric codes to human‑readable names for wallet discovery【F:core/opcode.go†L71-L85】. When the virtual machine executes an instruction, `Dispatch` resolves the handler and charges its base gas before invocation, guaranteeing consistent metering across clients【F:core/opcode.go†L106-L118】.

### Reference Lists
For external tooling, the project maintains human‑readable tables of opcodes under `docs/reference`. These lists document function names alongside their hex codes to simplify integration with monitoring and wallet software【F:docs/reference/opcodes_list.md†L1-L5】.

## Gas Pricing Framework
### Central Gas Table
Gas pricing is derived from a canonical table that maps opcode names to their base cost. The table is loaded from `docs/reference/gas_table_list.md` and cached on first use. Any opcode not explicitly priced receives the `DefaultGasCost` of one, ensuring new features remain executable without governance intervention【F:core/gas_table.go†L15-L33】【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L1-L6】.

### Loading and Caching
The table is parsed once and stored in memory using a `sync.Once` gate so that all threads share a consistent view of pricing. The parser streams `gas_table_list.md` line by line, trimming Markdown syntax and extracting backtick‑quoted names with numeric costs. Malformed rows silently fall back to the default cost so an incomplete guide never halts node start‑up【F:core/gas_table.go†L34-L88】. `LoadGasTable` then returns the cached map under read locks to keep lookups race‑free【F:core/gas_table.go†L90-L96】.

### Runtime API
The core package exposes utilities to adjust and inspect pricing at runtime. Operators or tests can set costs for individual opcodes, generate snapshots for audit, serialise the complete schedule to JSON, or query pricing by exported function name for high‑level tooling【F:core/gas_table.go†L70-L122】. `GasTableSnapshotJSON` emits hex‑keyed maps for downstream analytics, while `GasCostByName` resolves friendly function names through the opcode catalogue to retrieve current prices【F:core/gas_table.go†L93-L122】.

### Concurrency and Overrides
Gas pricing is guarded by read/write mutexes so concurrent queries remain safe【F:core/gas.go†L5-L28】. Helper functions report whether an opcode is priced, inject overrides at runtime and reset the cache for test isolation, giving governance processes fine‑grained control over execution fees【F:gas_table.go†L98-L133】.

## Operational Tooling
A dedicated CLI command allows authorised personnel to tune gas values or capture the current schedule. Costs can be modified with `synnergy gas set`, and snapshots can be exported in plain text or JSON to feed dashboards and regulatory systems【F:cli/gas_table.go†L11-L55】.

## Testing and Audit
Extensive tests confirm that gas overrides and snapshots behave deterministically. The suite verifies that unpriced opcodes default to zero gas, that updating a cost reflects immediately, that snapshots are immutable copies, and that named lookups fall back to default pricing when unknown【F:core/gas_test.go†L5-L12】【F:core/gas_table_test.go†L80-L99】. These guarantees ensure external systems can trust published gas schedules.

## Reference Guides
For comprehensive listings of every opcode and its baseline cost, the repository maintains Markdown references under `docs/reference`. `opcodes_list.md` maps human‑readable function names to their canonical hex codes, while `gas_table_list.md` enumerates the default pricing schedule【F:docs/reference/opcodes_list.md†L1-L8】【F:docs/reference/gas_table_list.md†L1-L8】. A more narrative explanation of operational categories and pricing rationales lives in `docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md`, providing deep context for auditors and integrators【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/opcode_and_gas_guide.md†L1-L5】.

## Summary
Through disciplined opcode cataloguing and transparent gas accounting, Blackridge Group Ltd. delivers predictable execution semantics across the Synnergy ecosystem. Deterministic pricing, runtime configurability and comprehensive tooling allow developers, operators and regulators to validate costs with confidence.

## Reversing and cancelling transactions

# Reversing and Cancelling Transactions

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network to provide enterprises with programmable, controllable digital value transfers.  Beyond simple fund movement, organisations require mechanisms to halt or undo operations when errors, disputes, or regulatory interventions arise.  The network therefore supports two complementary capabilities: **cancelling scheduled transactions** and **reversing confirmed transactions**.  Both functions preserve ledger integrity while allowing the ecosystem to recover from mistakes or fraudulent activity.

## Scheduled Transactions and Cancellation
The platform allows a payment to be staged for execution at a future time.  A
`ScheduledTransaction` wraps a normal transaction with an `ExecuteAt` timestamp
and a mutable `Canceled` flag.

### Data Model and Behaviour
`ScheduledTransaction` consists of:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Tx` | Pointer to the underlying transaction payload. |
| `ExecuteAt` | Absolute UNIX time at which the payment becomes valid. |
| `Canceled` | Boolean indicating whether the schedule has been revoked prior to execution. |

`ScheduleTransaction` merely creates this wrapper; orchestration services are
responsible for persisting and dispatching the transaction when `ExecuteAt`
elapses.  The cancellation logic is intentionally minimal: `CancelTransaction`
marks the record as cancelled when called before the deadline and returns a
boolean so callers can confirm success.  After the timestamp passes, attempts to
cancel gracefully fail.

### Workflow
1. **Scheduling** – `ScheduleTransaction` wraps a transaction with the target execution time.
2. **Cancellation window** – Prior to the scheduled time, participants may invoke `CancelTransaction`.  The routine returns `true` when the cancellation succeeds and marks the schedule as `Canceled`.
3. **Execution** – Uncancelled schedules execute at or after the specified timestamp.

### Interfaces
- **CLI** – The `tx control` command exposes `schedule` and `cancel` actions for
  operators who manage timed payments.
- **Virtual Machine** – SNVM opcodes `core_transaction_control_ScheduleTransaction`
  and `core_transaction_control_CancelTransaction` allow smart contracts to
  orchestrate timed transfers programmatically.

## Immediate Transaction Reversal
For transactions already committed to the ledger, a direct reversal is available
when the recipient retains the transferred amount.  `ReverseTransaction` works
as follows:

1. **Ledger lock** – the ledger mutex is acquired to isolate concurrent
   modifications.
2. **Balance check** – the recipient must hold at least the original amount; the
   fee is refunded from block rewards so only the amount is required on the
   recipient side.
3. **State adjustment** – the recipient’s balance is debited and the sender’s
   balance is credited with the amount plus fee.
4. **Unlock** – the mutex is released and the operation completes.

If the recipient lacks sufficient funds the routine aborts with an error,
preventing negative balances or monetary creation.

## Authority‑Mediated Reversals
In many jurisdictions a reversal requires oversight.  Synnergy introduces an authority‑driven workflow enabling trusted nodes to arbitrate disputes.

### Requesting a Reversal
`RequestReversal` freezes the recipient’s balance for the transaction amount plus an additional fee supplied by the requester.  This guarantees the funds remain available during the review process and records a `ReversalRequest` containing the transaction, fee and request time.

#### ReversalRequest Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Tx` | The transaction under dispute. |
| `RequestedAt` | Timestamp when the reversal was initiated. |
| `Fee` | Return-gas amount paid by the requester and reimbursed if the reversal succeeds. |
| `votes` | Map of authority identifiers to boolean approval decisions. |

### Voting and Finalisation
Authority nodes cast decisions using `Vote`.  When `FinalizeReversal` observes
the required approval threshold, it executes a compensating transfer from the
frozen funds back to the sender and credits the fee to the recipient to cover
gas costs.  The operation must complete within a 30‑day `reversalWindow`; if the
deadline elapses `RejectReversal` releases the frozen balance and records that
the request expired.

#### Processing Sequence
1. **Freeze** – `RequestReversal` deducts the amount+fee from the recipient and
   places it in the ledger’s `frozen` map.
2. **Vote** – authorities register approvals or rejections via `Vote`.
3. **Finalize** – once approvals meet the required quorum, `FinalizeReversal`
   re-credits the recipient’s frozen balance, constructs a compensating
   transaction and applies it to reimburse the sender.
4. **Reject** – if quorum is not reached within 30 days, `RejectReversal`
   restores the frozen funds to the recipient and marks the request failed.

#### Example Authority Workflow
```go
req, err := core.RequestReversal(ledger, tx, fee)
if err != nil { /* handle */ }
req.Vote("authority-1", true)
req.Vote("authority-2", true)
if err := core.FinalizeReversal(ledger, req, 2); err != nil {
    // reversal failed or quorum not met
}
```

## Ledger State and Fund Freezing
The ledger maintains both spendable balances and a `frozen` map that holds amounts reserved for pending reversals.  All operations lock the ledger’s state to maintain consistency under concurrency.  By segregating frozen funds the system prevents double‑spending while a dispute is active.

## Security and Governance Considerations
- **Multi‑party approval** – Reversal finalisation requires an explicit quorum of
  authority votes, providing checks and balances against unilateral rollbacks.
- **Time‑boxed review** – The 30‑day window motivates timely adjudication and
  avoids indefinite freezes.
- **Auditability** – Every action—scheduling, cancelling, requesting reversals,
  voting, and finalisation—produces deterministic state transitions suitable for
  auditing.
- **Error handling** – Both scheduling and reversal APIs return explicit error
  values enabling callers to react programmatically to insufficient balances or
  expired requests.

## Edge Cases and Failure Handling
- **Expired cancellation** – Calling `CancelTransaction` after `ExecuteAt`
  results in a graceful failure, leaving the schedule intact for execution.
- **Insufficient funds** – `ReverseTransaction` and `RequestReversal` both abort
  when the recipient lacks the required balance, ensuring the ledger never
  creates value.
- **Unmet quorum** – If the approval threshold is not reached within the
  `reversalWindow`, `RejectReversal` automatically releases frozen funds and the
  request is marked failed.

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Schedule a future transfer
synnergy tx control schedule alice bob 100 1 0 $(date -d "+1 hour" +%s)

# Cancel the scheduled transfer before execution
synnergy tx control cancel alice bob 100 1 0 $(date -d "+1 hour" +%s)

# Apply and immediately reverse a transaction on a fresh ledger
synnergy tx control reverse alice bob 100 1 0
```
Smart contracts and off‑chain services may call the corresponding SNVM opcodes
to achieve the same outcomes within automated workflows.

## Related Transaction Controls
- **Private transactions** – `ConvertToPrivate` encrypts a transaction using
  AES‑GCM so only holders of the key can inspect details.  `PrivateTransaction`
  objects can be decrypted and applied after inspection by the intended
  counterparties.
- **Receipts** – `GenerateReceipt` and `ReceiptStore` provide verifiable records
  of transaction outcomes, allowing auditors to trace reversals or cancellations
  long after execution.

## Best Practices
- Confirm recipient details before scheduling transfers to minimise reversal requests.
- Use cancellation for routine corrections; reserve authority‑mediated reversals for exceptional cases such as fraud or regulatory orders.
- Monitor outstanding reversal requests to ensure they conclude within the allowed window.

## Conclusion
Through these mechanisms Blackridge Group Ltd. equips the Synnergy Network with comprehensive transaction control.  Organisations can schedule payments confidently, revoke them when circumstances change, and rely on a governed reversal process when settlement errors must be rectified.  The combination of programmability and oversight delivers a resilient financial substrate for modern digital commerce.

Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring that scalability, security and usability evolve in tandem. Stakeholders are encouraged to follow repository updates and participate in governance discussions as the project progresses.

## Security Operations Center

# Security Operations Center

Blackridge Group Ltd's Security Operations Center (SOC) is the defensive nerve center of the Synnergy Network. It delivers continuous situational awareness by collecting telemetry from every node role, correlating anomalies with on‑chain activity and guiding operators through a hardened dashboard. The SOC is engineered to meet enterprise security, compliance and availability requirements while remaining lightweight enough for rapid deployment across diverse infrastructures.

## Strategic Objectives
- **Unified visibility** – aggregate logs, metrics and alerts from mining, staking, authority, watchtower and warfare nodes into a single operational view.
- **Real‑time threat detection** – surface suspicious patterns using pluggable analytics engines and correlate events with ledger state for precise impact analysis.
- **Rapid incident response** – enable administrators to trigger playbooks or automated mitigations through a CLI‑backed web interface.
- **Regulatory assurance** – preserve tamper‑evident audit trails and support fine‑grained access controls to satisfy internal and external compliance mandates.

## Architecture Overview
The SOC is implemented as a TypeScript service that loads runtime settings from `config/production.ts` and merges them with environment variables for flexible deployment【F:GUI/security-operations-center/config/production.ts†L1-L4】. The entry point in `src/main.ts` performs fault‑tolerant startup and emits a clear status message or exits with a non‑zero code on failure【F:GUI/security-operations-center/src/main.ts†L4-L15】.

Key components include:
- **Configuration layer** – environment‑driven parameters such as `API_URL` and log level provide consistent behavior across development, Docker and Kubernetes targets.
- **Service layer** – API wrappers under `src/services` manage resilient REST calls to Synnergy nodes through the function web, exposing hooks for dashboard widgets and automation.
- **Presentation layer** – `src/components` hosts React/Vue components (planned) that render alerts, metrics and remediation actions in the browser.
- **Testing harness** – Jest‑based unit and end‑to‑end suites verify startup behavior and API integration, ensuring reliable deployments.

## Telemetry Sources and Data Flow
The SOC ingests data from multiple runtime components to build a consolidated security picture:
- **Watchtower nodes** collect system health metrics every ten seconds, capturing CPU usage, memory consumption and peer counts for correlation【F:watchtower_node.go†L53-L63】【F:system_health_logging.go†L23-L35】.
- **Firewall rules** aggregate blocked wallet addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs, allowing the SOC to surface policy violations and push real‑time updates to node defenses【F:firewall.go†L5-L12】【F:firewall.go†L90-L104】.
- **Node logs and ledger events** stream through the function web, letting the SOC align infrastructure telemetry with on‑chain activity for forensic accuracy.
- **Metric snapshots** – in-memory health snapshots expose CPU, memory, peer counts and block height without disk I/O, enabling responsive dashboards and minimal storage overhead【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L48】.

## Data Ingestion and Analytics
1. **Log and metric collection** – nodes publish structured events (transactions, consensus state, validator health) to the function web where the SOC retrieves them via authenticated REST endpoints.
2. **Normalization** – incoming records are standardised and timestamped before entering the analysis pipeline.
3. **Threat correlation** – pluggable rules engines and AI modules (e.g., anomaly detection and drift monitoring) highlight deviations, enabling early detection of exploits or misconfigurations.
4. **Alert dissemination** – actionable findings are broadcast to operators through the GUI and can be forwarded to external SIEM or ticketing systems.

## Advanced Analytics and Automation
- **Statistical anomaly detection** – streaming mean/variance calculations flag abnormal metrics, letting the SOC spot outliers without storing raw histories【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.
- **Model-drift monitoring** – baseline comparisons highlight when AI model performance deviates beyond an operator-defined threshold, prompting retraining or rollback【F:ai_drift_monitor.go†L8-L34】.
- **Automated policy propagation** – detector outputs can trigger immediate firewall rule updates to quarantine suspicious accounts or peers.

## Alerting and Response
- **Interactive playbooks** – operators can initiate predefined mitigation scripts or invoke CLI commands directly from the dashboard to quarantine nodes or rotate credentials.
- **Automated enforcement** – firewall updates and rate limiting policies propagate immediately across participating nodes, minimizing manual intervention.
- **Test coverage** – unit and end‑to‑end tests ensure the startup routine honors environment variables and emits clear status messages before alerts are raised【F:GUI/security-operations-center/tests/unit/example.test.ts†L1-L10】【F:GUI/security-operations-center/tests/e2e/example.e2e.test.ts†L1-L10】.

## Identity Assurance and Secure Channels
- **Biometric access controls** – privileged actions may require biometric validation through nodes that only execute tasks after successful template verification【F:biometric_security_node.go†L8-L50】【F:biometrics_auth.go†L9-L45】.
- **Zero‑trust data channels** – encrypted channels backed by ed25519 signatures ensure that telemetry and response commands cannot be intercepted or forged during transit【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L114】.

## Deployment and Configuration
The module ships with straightforward operational commands:
- **Local execution** – `npm install` then `npm run build && node dist/main.js` starts the service with defaults【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L7-L13】.
- **Docker** – `docker compose up --build` encapsulates the SOC with its dependencies for repeatable environments【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L15-L18】.
- **Kubernetes** – manifests in `k8s/` enable cluster deployment via `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml`【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L20-L25】.
- **Testing** – `npm test` runs Jest suites to validate configuration parsing and startup output【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docs/README.md†L27-L31】.

Container artifacts support reproducible builds and high availability:
- A multi‑stage Dockerfile compiles sources and produces a minimal runtime image run as an unprivileged user【F:GUI/security-operations-center/Dockerfile†L1-L16】.
- `docker-compose.yml` exposes port `3000` and injects the API URL via environment variables for local orchestration【F:GUI/security-operations-center/docker-compose.yml†L1-L10】.
- The Kubernetes deployment defaults to two replicas and configures the internal API endpoint through a dedicated `API_URL` variable, enabling horizontal scaling across clusters【F:GUI/security-operations-center/k8s/deployment.yaml†L1-L22】.

## Infrastructure Automation
- **Helm chart** – a reusable chart packages the SOC for declarative Kubernetes rollouts alongside other network components【F:deploy/helm/synnergy/Chart.yaml†L1-L16】.
- **Terraform stack** – infrastructure as code provisions VPCs, subnets and auto‑scaling groups, embedding security groups for node communications【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L1-L52】【F:deploy/terraform/main.tf†L42-L62】.

## Integration with the Synnergy Network
- **Function web coupling** – the SOC communicates with nodes, authority services and wallets through the Synnergy function web, allowing dashboards to query status and invoke mitigations through the same interfaces used by other modules【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/synnergy_network_function_web.md†L29-L33】.
- **Authentication** – API tokens issued by the wallet service guard every request, ensuring only authorised operators can retrieve telemetry or trigger actions.
- **CLI synergy** – core Synnergy CLIs expose JSON responses that the SOC consumes for visualization, while operators can escalate from GUI alerts directly to scripted CLI remediation.

## Enterprise Security and Compliance
- **Secrets management** – environment variables and configuration files are the sole carriers of credentials, allowing integration with vault technologies during deployment.
- **Role-based access control** – the firewall and API layers restrict sensitive functions to authorised roles, aligning with zero‑trust principles.
- **Compliance posture** – immutable audit logs and policy-driven block lists provide verifiable evidence for regulatory audits and incident response.
- **Regulatory rule evaluation** – the RegulatoryManager enforces jurisdiction-specific limits and flags transactions exceeding configured thresholds【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】.
- **Address oversight** – the ComplianceManager suspends or whitelists accounts and blocks transactions involving sanctioned parties【F:compliance_management.go†L15-L78】.

## Operations and Governance
- **Access control** – role‑based permissions restrict sensitive dashboards and response actions to designated teams.
- **Audit logging** – immutable records of operator activity and system events support forensic investigations and compliance reporting.
- **Availability** – the SOC is stateless by design, enabling horizontal scaling and blue‑green deployments with zero downtime.

## Roadmap
Blackridge Group Ltd continues to enhance the SOC with:
- Deeper consensus and token analytics for richer attack surface visibility.
- Token‑based authorization schemes leveraging on‑chain identities.
- Machine‑learning models that adaptively tune detection thresholds.
- Extended integration with the smart contract marketplace for contract‑level monitoring.

## Conclusion
The Security Operations Center embodies Blackridge Group Ltd's commitment to proactive defense of the Synnergy Network. By unifying monitoring, analytics and response within a configurable, portable service, the SOC equips enterprises with the insight and control required to operate secure, compliant blockchain infrastructures at scale.

## Storage

# Storage

## Blackridge Group Ltd – Synnergy Network Storage Architecture

The storage layer of the Synnergy Network, engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd**, delivers a resilient and secure foundation for managing on‑chain and off‑chain data. It combines flexible node roles, encrypted communication channels, and a gas‑priced marketplace for decentralised capacity. This section explains the core components, operational workflows and future direction of the storage ecosystem.

---

## 1. Storage Principles

- **Durability and Flexibility** – Nodes choose between archive and pruned modes to balance historical fidelity with local resource constraints【F:core/full_node.go†L5-L12】.
- **Interoperable Data Services** – Structured feeds, distribution registries and resource managers expose a unified interface for content indexing and retrieval【F:data_operations.go†L1-L42】【F:data_distribution.go†L1-L32】.
- **Security by Design** – Encryption, sandboxing and zero‑trust channels protect data at rest and in transit【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L1-L45】【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L1-L52】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L1-L48】.

---

## 2. Node Storage Modes

Full nodes validate the network while storing the ledger in one of two modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Archive** | Retains the entire blockchain history for comprehensive auditing and analytics【F:core/full_node.go†L8-L12】 |
| **Pruned** | Keeps only recent blocks, enabling lightweight operation without sacrificing consensus integrity【F:core/full_node.go†L8-L12】 |

Historical nodes complement full nodes by archiving block summaries, allowing long‑term retrieval without forcing every participant to store the full chain.

---

## 3. Data Management Modules

Synnergy separates data concerns into modular services:

### Data Feeds and Distribution
`DataFeed` objects manage concurrent updates to external datasets, while the `DataDistribution` registry records which nodes host specific content sets and automatically prunes stale offerings【F:data_operations.go†L9-L33】【F:data_distribution.go†L23-L45】.

### Resource Management
`DataResourceManager` supplies lightweight key–value storage with byte‑level accounting, ensuring smart contracts and services can track usage and enforce quotas【F:data_resource_management.go†L5-L28】.

### Secure Storage for Models
The `SecureStorage` facility encrypts AI model bytes with AES‑GCM, storing only sealed payloads and requiring 32‑byte keys for retrieval【F:ai_secure_storage.go†L12-L45】.

### Sandboxed Execution
The `SandboxManager` orchestrates isolated contract environments with configurable gas and memory limits. Each sandbox can be started, reset or deleted without impacting neighbouring workloads【F:vm_sandbox_management.go†L9-L52】.

### Content Nodes and Discovery
`ContentNode` instances encrypt large assets with AES‑GCM before assigning them deterministic SHA‑256 identifiers, while `ContentNetworkNode` registries advertise which peers host particular content for network‑wide discovery【F:content_node_impl.go†L14-L57】【F:content_node.go†L5-L33】.

### Archival and Holographic Extensions
`HistoricalNode` archives block summaries for retrieval by height or hash, and `HolographicNode` distributes redundant frames to preserve data availability across outages【F:internal/nodes/historical_node.go†L8-L70】【F:internal/nodes/holographic_node.go†L9-L37】.

### Forensic Audit Support
`ForensicNode` records lightweight transaction snapshots and network traces, enabling post‑incident analysis without exposing the full ledger【F:internal/nodes/forensic_node.go†L8-L88】.

---

## 4. Metadata and Indexing

Synnergy augments raw storage with rich discovery and search capabilities:

### Distributed Hash Table
The lightweight `Kademlia` implementation stores metadata with XOR‑distance lookups, allowing nodes to locate peers or content based on cryptographic identifiers【F:core/kademlia.go†L1-L48】.

### In‑Memory Indexing
`IndexingNode` instances maintain thread‑safe key/value maps for rapid queries against ledger snapshots or application datasets【F:indexing_node.go†L1-L39】.

### Domain‑Specific Catalogues
Specialised nodes, such as the `GeospatialNode`, collect structured records like latitude and longitude histories for tracked subjects【F:geospatial_node.go†L8-L31】.

---

## 5. Zero‑Trust Data Channels

The Zero‑Trust Engine establishes encrypted communication channels backed by per‑channel key pairs. Messages are signed with Ed25519, encrypted, and stored for later verification and decryption, enabling confidential exchanges across untrusted networks【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L9-L68】.

---

## 6. Storage Marketplace

### Marketplace Structure
`StorageMarketplace` offers a concurrency‑safe registry of storage listings and deals. Each operation is telemetry‑instrumented and priced through the network’s gas table to limit abuse and provide predictable fees【F:core/storage_marketplace.go†L28-L69】.

### Listing and Deal Workflow
1. **Create Listing** – A provider registers a content hash, price and owner address. Insufficient gas rejects the request【F:core/storage_marketplace.go†L53-L69】.
2. **List Listings** – Consumers query available offers, returned as JSON via CLI or GUI adapters【F:core/storage_marketplace.go†L71-L82】.
3. **Open Deal** – Buyers initiate a deal against a specific listing, again subject to gas limits【F:core/storage_marketplace.go†L84-L100】.
4. **Close Deal** – Once fulfilled, deals are removed, releasing associated resources【F:core/storage_marketplace.go†L103-L116】.

### Tooling and Automation
Command‑line utilities (`storage_marketplace` and helper scripts) streamline listing creation and pinning of assets, enabling rapid integration into deployment pipelines and testing environments.

---

## 7. Operations and Automation

Shell helpers invoke the Synnergy binaries to pin data or advertise marketplace capacity, simplifying continuous‑integration jobs and operator runbooks【F:cmd/scripts/storage_pin.sh†L1-L7】【F:scripts/storage_setup.sh†L1-L18】.

The toolkit also includes backup utilities like `backup_ledger.sh` for timestamped ledger archives, ensuring that critical state can be restored after failures【F:scripts/backup_ledger.sh†L1-L38】.

---

## 8. Security, Audit, and Compliance

- **Encrypted Payloads** – All sensitive data is encrypted before storage, whether model bytes or inter‑node messages.
- **Access Control** – Sandboxes and marketplace operations require explicit gas budgets, curbing denial‑of‑service vectors.
- **Auditability** – Archive nodes and historical archives provide immutable records, supporting regulatory audits and forensic analysis.
- **Event Logging** – The `AuditManager` and lightweight `AuditLog` capture chronological records of node events for later review【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L45】【F:internal/governance/audit_log.go†L1-L24】.
- **Receipt Retention** – A thread‑safe `ReceiptStore` preserves transaction outcomes, enabling compliance checks and dispute resolution【F:core/transaction_control.go†L173-L203】.

Planned smart contracts (e.g., GDPR‑compliant storage, versioned archives and SLA enforcement) extend these protections to specialised jurisdictions and enterprise use cases.

---

## 9. Future Outlook

Blackridge Group Ltd is expanding the storage layer with distributed backends (IPFS, Arweave and others), contractual SLAs and cross‑chain replication. Ongoing development will surface these capabilities through the same gas‑priced, contract‑driven interfaces that power today’s marketplace.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The Synnergy Network’s storage architecture delivers a holistic framework for data durability, confidentiality and monetisation. By combining modular services, strict security controls and an extensible marketplace, Blackridge Group Ltd enables organisations to store and exchange digital assets with enterprise‑grade assurance.

## Tokenomics

# Tokenomics

*Prepared by Blackridge Group Ltd.*

## 1. Economic Overview
The Synnergy Network employs a multifaceted economic model that aligns incentives for validators, developers, token holders and the wider community. Its native currency, the Synthron coin (SYN), underpins governance, secures consensus, and fuels on‑chain activity. Purpose‑built token classes extend utility across real‑world assets, stable value instruments, index products, and specialized enterprise use cases.

## 2. Native Currency – Synthron (SYN)
### 2.1 Supply and Emission Schedule
The Synthron coin is capped at a maximum supply of 500 million SYN with an initial genesis allocation of 5 million SYN to the creator’s wallet【F:core/coin.go†L9-L14】. Block rewards begin at 1,252 SYN and halve every 200,000 blocks, producing a deterministic issuance curve that rapidly approaches the cap【F:core/coin.go†L15-L16】【F:configs/network.yaml†L12-L15】.

#### 2.1.1 Emission Forecast
Using the default three‑second block time, each halving epoch spans roughly 6.9 days. The `CirculatingSupply` and `RemainingSupply` helpers allow operators to model supply at any height for treasury and risk analysis【F:core/coin.go†L28-L49】. The table and chart below project the reward schedule and circulating supply across the first seven epochs until the cap is reached.

| Epoch | Approx. day | Reward per block (SYN) | Coins minted in epoch (M SYN) | Cumulative supply (M SYN) |
|------:|------------:|-----------------------:|------------------------------:|--------------------------:|
| 1 | 6.9 | 1,252.00 | 250.40 | 255.40 |
| 2 | 13.9 | 626.00 | 125.20 | 380.60 |
| 3 | 20.8 | 313.00 | 62.60 | 443.20 |
| 4 | 27.8 | 156.50 | 31.30 | 474.50 |
| 5 | 34.7 | 78.25 | 15.65 | 490.15 |
| 6 | 41.7 | 39.13 | 7.83 | 497.98 |
| 7 | 48.6 | 19.56 | 2.03 | 500.00 |

    5: 490.15
    6: 497.98
    7: 500
```

### 2.2 Staking and Treasury Flows
Validators must meet a minimum stake derived from network volatility and participation rates. `AlphaFactor` and `MinimumStake` compute required collateral, while `LockupDuration` aligns reward boosts to longer commitments, ensuring long‑term alignment between validators and network health【F:core/coin.go†L57-L80】. Treasury holdings are invested conservatively and returns are recycled into staking rewards proportional to lock duration.【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L678-L688】

### 2.3 Stability Mechanisms
A stabilization module maintains a reserve of diversified assets. If SYN’s market price deviates beyond ±5% over a week, the module mints or burns SYN against the reserve to restore parity, with governance retaining the ability to adjust parameters or replenish collateral【F:Synnergy_Network_Future_Of_Blockchan.md†L691-L694】.

### 2.4 Slashing and Penalty Controls
Misbehaving validators face stake reductions and recorded penalties. The stake penalty manager adjusts validator balances and logs infractions with timestamps, enabling transparent slashing and rehabilitative policies【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L53】.

## 3. Transaction Fee Economy
### 3.1 Fee Calculation Pipeline
Transaction fees comprise three components—base, variable and priority—and are computed as:

`F_total = F_base + F_variable + F_priority`

- **Base fee**: `CalculateBaseFee` takes the median of the most recent 1,000 block fees and multiplies it by a load adjustment factor so base charges track network congestion【F:core/fees.go†L28-L45】.
- **Variable fee**: `CalculateVariableFee` multiplies resource units (gas, calls or computation) by the per‑unit gas price, capturing workload intensity【F:core/fees.go†L48-L50】.
- **Priority fee**: `CalculatePriorityFee` passes through an optional user tip to incentivise faster inclusion【F:core/fees.go†L53-L54】.

Specialised helpers such as `FeeForTransfer`, `FeeForPurchase`, `FeeForTokenUsage`, `FeeForContract` and `FeeForWalletVerification` combine these elements for different transaction classes【F:core/fees.go†L56-L88】. Verified zero‑fee transfers bypass charges through `FeeForValidatedTransfer`, enabling promotional or subsidy campaigns when flagged as eligible【F:core/fees.go†L91-L99】.

Enterprise fee governance is enforced by a global `FeePolicy`; `ApplyFeeCapFloor` clamps charges within configured ceilings and floors, while `Enforce` documents any adjustment for audit trails【F:core/fees.go†L131-L158】. Dynamic load is accounted for by `AdjustFeeRates`, which scales base and variable rates proportionally to observed utilisation【F:core/fees.go†L160-L169】. The validator reward pool further adjusts ±10% based on block utilisation to discourage underfilled or congested blocks【F:core/fees.go†L240-L254】.

### 3.2 Fee Redistribution Framework
Transaction fees are redistributed in real time to sustain the ecosystem and reward contributors. The allocation model is as follows:

| Allocation Target | Share of Fees |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Internal development | 5% |
| Internal charity | 5% |
| External charity | 5% |
| Loan pool for startups and SMEs | 5% |
| Passive income for token holders | 5% |
| Validators and miners | 64% |
| Authority node incentives | 5% |
| Node host incentives | 5% |
| Creator wallet | 1% |

```mermaid
pie title Fee Redistribution
    "Validators & Miners" : 64
    "Authority Nodes" : 5
    "Internal Development" : 5
    "Internal Charity" : 5
    "External Charity" : 5
    "Loan Pool" : 5
    "Passive Income" : 5
    "Node Hosts" : 5
    "Creator" : 1
```

This structure balances infrastructure investment, social impact, and operational incentives【F:core/fees.go†L115-L127】. For bespoke accounting, `ShareProportional` can further split any fee pot across weighted addresses with deterministic remainder handling, and `FeeDistributionContract` credits those shares to the ledger for transparent settlement【F:core/fees.go†L194-L238】.

### 3.3 Genesis Wallet Architecture
At network launch, dedicated wallets are created to manage these allocations, including genesis rewards, development funds, internal and external charity wallets, loan pool reserves, holder reward pools, node host distributions, and creator funds. Each wallet operates under transparent governance with periodic reporting to the community, and addresses are deterministically derived from hashed labels to facilitate independent auditing【F:docs/Whitepaper_detailed/guide/transaction_guide.md†L817-L838】【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L41】.

### 3.4 Gas Pricing Model
Opcode execution costs are enumerated in a dynamically loaded gas table. Default pricing keeps experimental opcodes affordable while explicit entries cover bridges, governance operations, node management, and compliance queries so enterprises can predict transaction expenses【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】.

## 4. Token Classes

## Tokens

# Tokens

## Introduction
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the Synnergy Network token framework to support a diverse ecosystem of digital assets. Each token type encapsulates specific business logic, enabling regulated financial operations, real‑world asset representation and community governance. The architecture combines secure ledgers, structured registries and extensible smart‑contract interfaces to allow token classes to operate independently while remaining interoperable across the network.

## Token Framework Overview
Tokens on Synnergy Network are implemented as Go modules that maintain their own state and persistence model. Ledgers and registries are used to manage balances, metadata and transactional history. This modular approach allows Blackridge Group Ltd. to:

- Tailor functionality to the asset class or utility.
- Enforce compliance through whitelists, blacklists and certification metadata.
- Provide deterministic APIs for minting, transferring, burning and querying tokens.

## Monetary and Financial Instruments
### SYN10 – Central Bank Digital Currency
`syn10.go` embeds a base ledger and protects issuer metadata and exchange
rates with a dedicated mutex. The `SetExchangeRate` function atomically
updates the fiat peg while `Info` exposes the current issuer details and
total supply for audit trails.

### SYN11 – Central Bank Digital Gilts
`syn11_token.go` models government bond instruments issued by central banks.
Fixed‑rate metadata tracks coupon schedules and redemption amounts, letting
treasuries settle gilt obligations on chain.

### SYN12 – Tokenised Treasury Bill

discount and face value. Instances are created via `NewSYN12Token`, which
captures the immutable `SYN12Metadata` used for settlement calculations.

### SYN20 – Pausable and Freezable Ledger
`syn20.go` extends the base token with emergency controls. Mutex‑guarded
flags allow administrators to pause all transfers or freeze specific
addresses, and overrides ensure `Transfer`, `Mint` and `Burn` respect these
restrictions.

### SYN1000 – Reserve‑Backed Stablecoin
`syn1000.go` tracks backing assets as high‑precision rational numbers and
guards the reserve map with a read/write mutex. Functions such as
`AddReserve`, `SetReservePrice` and `TotalReserveValue` let operators manage
collateral transparently.

### SYN1000 Index – Stablecoin Manager

## Token Lifecycle
1. **Creation and Minting** – New tokens or assets are registered through constructors such as `NewTangibleAssetRegistry`, `NewSYN3500Token` or `NewAgriculturalRegistry`.
2. **Transfer and Ownership Management** – Ledgers expose safe `Transfer` functions that validate balances and authorisation. Asset tokens like SYN1700 or SYN130 update ownership directly within their registries.
3. **Burning and Redemption** – Tokens such as the DAO ledger and SYN3500 support deflationary operations through `Burn` or `Redeem` methods.
4. **Valuation and Status Updates** – Asset classes include methods like `UpdateValuation`, `UpdateStatus` or `SetRate` to reflect market or lifecycle changes.
5. **Audit and History** – Many token structures append events to historical arrays, creating immutable audit logs vital for regulatory review.
6. **Cross‑Chain Settlement** – Tokens such as SYN5000 surface hooks for bridge services so balances and bets can move between chains without breaking accounting.
7. **CLI and API Automation** – Each module ships with matching CLI commands under `cli/` enabling enterprises to script minting, transfers and registry queries.

## Security and Compliance
Blackridge Group Ltd. embeds security controls across token modules:

- **Whitelisting & Blacklisting** – SYN223 prevents illicit transfers by validating recipient addresses.
- **Certification Metadata** – SYN800 and SYN4900 tokens record certification details to meet industry standards.
- **Mutex‑Protected State** – Concurrency locks across ledgers and registries protect against race conditions during transactions.
- **Provenance Tracking** – Event histories in SYN1300, SYN4900 and lease/sale records in SYN130 provide full traceability for asset provenance.
- **Access‑Controlled Records** – SYN1100 gates healthcare data behind granular access lists to maintain patient confidentiality.
- **Dispute Logging** – SYN4700 records legal disputes and status transitions to support evidentiary workflows.

## Interoperability
Although each token manages its own state, consistent Go interfaces enable integration with other modules such as the virtual machine, cross‑chain bridge and governance services. Registries can be exposed via APIs or smart contracts, allowing tokens to participate in broader DeFi, supply‑chain or charity ecosystems managed by Blackridge Group Ltd.

By aligning token logic with real‑world processes—governance, asset custody, supply‑chain tracking and charitable giving—the platform equips partners to build sophisticated decentralised applications while maintaining regulatory rigour and operational transparency.

## Transaction fee distribution

# Transaction Fee Distribution

Blackridge Group Ltd.'s Synnergy Network employs a transparent and programmable fee model that funds ecosystem growth while incentivizing network actors. This document details how fees are computed, how they are adjusted for enterprise policy, and how every collected unit is allocated across the platform.

## Fee Components

Synnergy transactions expose three fee components, allowing dynamic pricing and user-driven prioritisation:

- **Base Fee** – Derived from the median fee of the last 1,000 blocks and adjusted by current network load. This smooths volatility and anchors fees to recent economic activity.
- **Variable Fee** – Scales with the resources consumed by a transaction. Depending on the transaction type, this may reflect data size, contract calls, computation units or security level.
- **Priority Fee (Tip)** – Optional user-specified amount that elevates a transaction’s priority during congestion.

These components are combined into a `FeeBreakdown` structure, enabling downstream services to reason about each portion independently.

## Fee Calculation Mechanics

1. **Base Fee Sampling**
   - The `CalculateBaseFee` function sorts recent block fees, selects the median, then applies an adjustment factor to reflect network conditions【F:core/fees.go†L28-L46】.
2. **Variable Fee Determination**
   - `CalculateVariableFee` multiplies gas units by gas price per unit, accommodating resource-heavy operations【F:core/fees.go†L48-L50】.
3. **Priority Fee Inclusion**
   - `CalculatePriorityFee` directly returns the user’s tip, allowing wallets to surface the explicit prioritisation amount【F:core/fees.go†L53-L54】.
4. **Transaction-Type Abstraction**
   - `EstimateFee` orchestrates the above components across five transaction categories (transfer, purchase, token interaction, contract, wallet verification) ensuring consistent logic across the ecosystem【F:core/fees.go†L172-L189】.
5. **Network Load Adjustments**
   - `AdjustFeeRates` scales both base and variable fees by a load factor, encouraging throughput during busy periods while remaining predictable under light usage【F:core/fees.go†L160-L169】.
6. **Policy Enforcement**
   - `ApplyFeeCapFloor` constrains fees to governance‑defined limits, and `FeePolicy` surfaces explanatory notes when caps or floors trigger, enabling boards to communicate pricing boundaries to wallets and exchanges【F:core/fees.go†L130-L158】.
7. **Feeless Transfer Validation**
   - `FeeForValidatedTransfer` returns zero fees for pre-approved flows, enabling charitable or promotional transfers to bypass charges while defaulting to standard fees when validation fails【F:core/fees.go†L91-L99】.

## Transaction Prioritisation

Optimisation nodes order mem‑pool transactions by fee density (fee per byte). This deterministic selection ensures blocks maximise revenue while adhering to size constraints【F:internal/nodes/optimization_nodes/index.go†L13-L35】.

## Gas and Opcode Pricing

Variable fees reference a comprehensive gas table that prices each virtual machine opcode. `GasTable` loads costs from `gas_table_list.md`, caching results and falling back to a default for unknown operations【F:gas_table.go†L18-L37】【F:gas_table.go†L49-L88】. Tooling retrieves prices through `GasCost` and can register overrides at runtime for governance-driven adjustments or testing scenarios【F:gas_table.go†L98-L106】【F:gas_table.go†L115-L124】.

## Fee Distribution Framework

Once a transaction is included, the ledger deducts `amount + fee` from the sender and credits the recipient with the amount, isolating the fee for distribution【F:core/ledger.go†L148-L169】.

`DistributeFees` allocates the collected fee across nine strategic pools, each supporting a pillar of the Synnergy ecosystem【F:core/fees.go†L101-L127】:

| Allocation Target        | Percentage |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Internal Development     | 5%         |
| Internal Charity         | 5%         |
| External Charity         | 5%         |
| Loan Pool                | 5%         |
| Passive Income Program   | 5%         |
| Validators & Miners      | 64%        |
| Authority Node Incentives| 5%         |
| Node Host Rewards        | 5%         |
| Creator Wallet           | 1%         |

The validator/miner pool can be further apportioned using `ShareProportional`, which ensures deterministic rounding by assigning any remainder to the highest-weighted participant【F:core/fees.go†L194-L221】.

### Block Utilisation Modifier

To promote efficient block usage, the validator/miner pool is adjusted based on realised block capacity. Utilisation above 90% yields a 10% bonus, while utilisation below 50% incurs a 10% reduction【F:core/fees.go†L240-L255】.

## Genesis and Treasury Addresses

`DefaultGenesisWallets` defines deterministic addresses for each allocation category using hashed labels, ensuring transparency from network launch【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L41】. The `AllocateToGenesisWallets` helper applies the standard distribution to these wallets, forming the basis of Synnergy’s treasury and philanthropic reserves【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L44-L58】.

## Distribution Execution

Smart‑contract style distribution is simulated via `FeeDistributionContract`, which credits ledger accounts with their calculated share【F:core/fees.go†L223-L238】. The same logic powers CLI utilities for genesis initialisation, ongoing fee splits and auditability.

## Dispute Resolution and Refunds

In rare cases where transactions must be reversed, authority nodes coordinate a structured refund process. `RequestReversal` freezes the recipient's balance for the transfer amount plus the return fee, preventing double‑spend attempts while the dispute is evaluated【F:core/transaction_control.go†L60-L71】. Once sufficient approvals are gathered within the 30‑day reversal window, `FinalizeReversal` releases the frozen funds and executes a compensating transaction that carries the original fee back to the sender【F:core/transaction_control.go†L79-L105】. If approvals fail or the window expires, `RejectReversal` unfreezes the funds and the request is logged for audit trails【F:core/transaction_control.go†L107-L114】.

## Validator Penalties and Risk Management

To preserve network integrity, the `StakePenaltyManager` tracks validator stake balances and accumulates penalty points for misbehaviour or downtime. Stake can be adjusted up or down and infractions are recorded with reasons and timestamps, enabling governance bodies to modulate future fee shares or slash rewards when necessary【F:stake_penalty.go†L8-L58】.

## Service-Level and Market Fees

Beyond protocol fees, application modules may charge their own service fees. The on‑chain `LiquidityPool` for token swaps expresses fees in basis points (`FeeBps`) and deducts them from swap inputs before updating reserves, allowing DEX operators to feed revenue into the standard distribution channels or custom incentives【F:core/liquidity_pools.go†L23-L28】【F:core/liquidity_pools.go†L95-L106】.

## Audit and Compliance Logging

Enterprise deployments require transparent reporting. The `AuditManager` records per-address events with metadata and timestamps, allowing downstream systems to reconstruct fee movements【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L49】. Building on this ledger, the `ComplianceService` validates KYC commitments, records fraud signals, maintains risk scores and exposes immutable audit trails for each address. It can also monitor transaction amounts for anomalies and verify zero‑knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving compliance checks【F:core/compliance.go†L55-L99】【F:core/compliance.go†L111-L133】.

## CLI Tooling

Blackridge Group provides command‑line tools to interact with the fee system:

- `tx fee` – Estimates fees and shows the resulting distribution, enforcing optional caps and floors via `--cap` and `--floor` flags【F:cli/transaction.go†L79-L117】.
- `fees estimate` – Quick fee forecasts incorporating live network load【F:cli/fees.go†L17-L55】.
- `fees feedback` – Sends user feedback on fee estimates for continuous tuning【F:cli/fees.go†L57-L66】.
- `fees share` – Computes proportional splits between validators and miners for customised weighting【F:cli/fees.go†L74-L83】.
- `genesis allocate` – Applies distribution logic to genesis wallets, displaying per‑address allocations【F:cli/genesis.go†L36-L50】.

## Self-Sustaining Economic Model

Synnergy’s fee allocation ensures the chain finances its own evolution without perpetual external funding. Each block channels a defined percentage of revenue into engineering, infrastructure and community treasuries through `DistributeFees`, creating a closed loop where usage directly bankrolls future upgrades and outreach【F:core/fees.go†L101-L127】. Deterministic wallet assignments codified in `DefaultGenesisWallets` and `AllocateToGenesisWallets` guarantee these reserves are transparently routed to long-term development and operations from genesis onward【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L28-L58】.

Validator rewards dynamically scale with network demand. `AdjustForBlockUtilization` increases the validator/miner pool when blocks are near capacity and tapers payouts during periods of underuse, aligning security expenditure with real throughput and keeping resource costs predictable for enterprises【F:core/fees.go†L240-L255】. Governance bodies can further stabilise revenue by enforcing fee caps or floors, shielding mission-critical applications from volatility while maintaining sufficient income for network stewardship【F:core/fees.go†L130-L158】.

## Universal Basic Income Forecast

Five percent of every fee funds Synnergy’s Passive Income program, a dedicated pool designed to evolve into a universal basic income for all verified participants【F:core/fees.go†L101-L127】. The `IDRegistry` records identity-backed wallets eligible for distributions, preventing Sybil attacks and enabling targeted payouts【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L27】. When the treasury releases funds, `ShareProportional` divides the pool across registered addresses with deterministic rounding, allowing administrators to weight allocations or deliver equal shares at scale【F:core/fees.go†L194-L221】.

Assuming an average network fee of 0.02 SYN and 1,000,000 daily transactions, the Passive Income pool would accrue 1,000 SYN per day. With 100,000 registered citizens, each could receive roughly 0.01 SYN daily. As adoption and transaction volume rise, the pool compounds, moving closer to a sustainable baseline income for all participants. Enterprises can forecast longer-term payouts by modelling projected transaction growth against the fixed five‑percent contribution and adjusting eligibility thresholds to balance inclusivity with economic prudence.

## Summary

Through a modular fee model, comprehensive gas accounting, and a clearly defined distribution schema, the Synnergy Network channels transaction revenue into development, community programmes, validator incentives and long‑term sustainability. Blackridge Group Ltd. ensures every fee reinforces the ecosystem, balancing profitability with social impact, regulatory compliance and operational resilience.

## Understanding the ledger

# Understanding the Ledger

## Introduction
Within the Synnergy Network by **Blackridge Group Ltd.**, the ledger is the authoritative record that synchronises value and state across every node. It combines block history, account balances, and unspent transaction outputs into a consistent dataset that applications, regulators, and end users can trust. The design targets enterprise deployments, weaving regulatory tooling, cross‑chain gateways and high‑availability services directly into core ledger functions.

## Core Data Structures
### Blocks and Sub-Blocks
- **Blocks**: Ordered collections of transactions mined by validator or mining nodes. Each block references the hash of its predecessor, forming an immutable chain. Proof‑of‑Work over the block header finalises the structure and anchors it to the existing history.
- **Sub-Blocks**: Interim containers of validator-approved transactions. They enable parallel validation before final block assembly and carry a proof‑of‑history hash signed by the validator, linking consensus stages together.

### Accounts and Balances
- The ledger maintains a map of addresses to their token balances.
- Balances change through credits, mints, and transfers. Each mutation is synchronised via mutexes to ensure thread-safe updates.

### Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)
- For auditability, the ledger derives a UTXO set from balances. Every balance change generates a new UTXO, enabling deterministic reconstruction of account state.

### Mempool
- Pending transactions are stored in a mempool. Nodes draw from this pool to build sub-blocks and blocks, ensuring fair ordering and throughput.

### Data Access and Indexing
- Indexing nodes mirror ledger data into key/value stores to accelerate enterprise queries and analytics, enabling fast lookups without disturbing consensus processing.

## Ledger Architecture and Node Roles
- **Mining and Validator Nodes**: Secure the chain through proof‑of‑work and proof‑of‑history, assemble sub‑blocks, and author new blocks while distributing rewards.
- **Staking Nodes**: Lock collateral to participate in consensus and expose APIs for delegators to bond or withdraw stake.
- **Indexing Nodes**: Provide read‑optimised mirrors of the chain for analytics, compliance checks, and historical lookups without impacting validator throughput.
- **Regulatory Nodes**: Enforce jurisdictional policies, evaluate risk scores, and coordinate freezes or reversals alongside authority nodes.
- **Watchtower and High‑Availability Services**: Monitor for forks or downtime and trigger failover routines so enterprise clusters remain online.

## Transaction Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Clients craft transactions specifying sender, recipient, amount, fee, nonce, and optional metadata such as biometric hashes.
2. **Validation**: Nodes verify digital signatures, check balances, and apply regulatory or biometric rules.
3. **Mempool Admission**: Validated transactions enter the mempool awaiting inclusion in a sub-block.
4. **Sub-Block Aggregation**: Validator nodes assemble transactions into sub-blocks and sign them.
5. **Mining and Finalisation**: Mining nodes combine sub-blocks into full blocks, compute proof-of-work, and append the block to the ledger.
6. **State Update**: Upon block acceptance, balances and UTXO sets are atomically updated and the mempool is pruned.

## Advanced Transaction Controls
- **Scheduled Transactions**: Payments can be queued for future execution and cancelled prior to their trigger time, enabling automated disbursements and payroll cycles.
- **Reversals and Freezes**: Authority nodes may freeze funds and coordinate reversal votes. Upon sufficient approvals, compensating transactions repay the sender while fees are deducted from the frozen balance.
- **Private Transfers**: Transactions can be converted to encrypted payloads using AES‑GCM, allowing confidential exchange that only authorised parties can decrypt.
- **Receipts and Audit Trails**: Every transaction can generate a signed receipt stored in thread‑safe registries, providing verifiable proof for accounting and dispute resolution.

## Smart Contract Execution
- **Virtual Machine**: A sandboxed execution engine validates contract bytecode, meters gas, and persists state transitions back into the ledger.
- **Contract Governance**: Upgrade hooks and approval workflows ensure only authorised code can be deployed or modified, preventing unvetted logic from affecting balances.
- **Deterministic Results**: All nodes replay contract execution identically, guaranteeing that side effects are consistent across the network.

## Persistence and Recovery
- The ledger optionally writes every block to a write-ahead log (WAL). On restart, nodes replay the WAL to restore state without re‑synchronising from peers.
- Snapshot utilities compress current state into portable archives that can be stored off-chain for audits or disaster recovery.

## Replication and Distribution
- A replication module broadcasts newly mined blocks or snapshots to peers, ensuring convergence on the latest chain head.
- Synchronisation routines validate incoming data and resolve forks, providing eventual consistency across the network.
- Dedicated synchronisation managers track download height and coordinate catch‑up rounds for lagging nodes.

## Performance and Scalability
- **High‑Availability Clustering**: Redundant nodes use leader election and heartbeat monitoring to fail over seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Consensus Hopping**: Validators can pivot between consensus modes to maintain throughput during spikes or faults.
- **Energy‑Efficient Nodes**: Optional low‑power profiles reduce resource usage for archival and edge deployments without sacrificing validation.

## Security, Identity and Compliance
- Immutable histories prevent tampering with past transactions. The genesis block is guarded by an immutability verifier that ensures its hash cannot be altered.
- The identity service links addresses to verified profiles and records verification attempts, giving enterprises strong provenance over participants.
- A compliance service manages KYC commitments, fraud signals and risk scores, producing comprehensive audit trails for regulators.
- Accounts can be frozen for regulatory holds, and suspicious activity is flagged through automated compliance checks.
- Zero‑trust channels allow privacy-preserving escrow and message exchange, binding releases of locked funds to verified conditions.

## Governance and Access Control
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Access control lists restrict sensitive operations to authorised keys held by governance councils or automated policies.
- **Multi-Signature Approvals**: High-value actions such as contract upgrades require multiple signers, reducing single-point compromise.
- **On-Chain Voting**: Governance proposals can be anchored to ledger ballots, enabling transparent policy changes and parameter tuning.

## Integration with Consensus and Cross-Chain Features
- Consensus algorithms determine which mined block becomes canonical, distributing rewards and adjusting stake weights accordingly.
- Cross-chain bridges lock assets on origin chains and credit recipients once proofs are validated, making the ledger the settlement layer for cross-network transfers.

## Maintenance and Tooling
- Command-line utilities enable operators to query balances, inspect blocks, mint or transfer tokens, and manage snapshots.
- Scheduled scripts archive ledger data into timestamped backups, supporting long‑term retention and regulatory audits.

## Operational Monitoring and Auditing
- **Health Logging**: System health services stream metrics on latency, fork rates, and resource usage into central dashboards.
- **Audit Logs**: Every administrative command is recorded with signer identity and timestamp, meeting stringent compliance requirements.
- **Alerting**: Watchtower nodes and monitoring hooks raise alerts for abnormal chain events or integrity violations.

## Future Enhancements
Blackridge Group Ltd. continues to refine the ledger with research into adaptive sharding, incremental pruning, and erasure-coded replication streams to further improve throughput and resilience.

## Conclusion
The ledger is the heartbeat of Synnergy Network operations. Through deterministic state management, robust persistence, and integration with consensus, compliance, and cross-chain modules, it delivers a secure and interoperable foundation for decentralised applications and financial services.

## Use Cases

# Use Cases

## Overview
The Synnergy Network, engineered by **Blackridge Group Ltd**, provides a modular blockchain platform designed for high assurance, regulatory alignment, and operational versatility. The codebase implements a rich catalogue of services and node types that enable enterprises, governments, and developers to deploy tailored distributed solutions. The following use cases illustrate how the network's capabilities combine to address real‑world requirements across sectors.

## Decentralized Finance and Asset Management
### Token issuance and management
Core modules such as `contracts.go`, `staking_node.go`, and `faucet.go` allow regulated entities to mint, distribute, and lock native assets. These services underpin stablecoins, staking rewards, and governance instruments while enforcing the monetary policies encoded by **Blackridge Group Ltd**.

### Cross‑chain liquidity
The `cross_chain_bridge.go` and `cross_chain_transactions.go` components provide verifiable lock‑and‑mint or burn‑and‑release flows so value can traverse external networks without trusted intermediaries. Companion logic in `cross_chain_contracts.go` keeps business rules interoperable across heterogeneous ledgers.

### AI‑driven risk assessment
Services defined in `ai.go` perform fraud scoring, base‑fee optimisation, and volume forecasting. Deployed models evaluate real‑time mempool activity so decentralised exchanges and lending pools can automatically adjust collateralisation or pause execution during suspicious spikes.

### Treasury and compliance automation
Modules like `regulatory_management.go`, `regulatory_node.go`, and smart‑contract templates in `smart-contracts/solidity` codify treasury limits, sanction lists, and tax rules. Automated checks on every transfer ensure corporate treasuries remain compliant across jurisdictions while enabling programmable disbursements and escrow services.

## Identity and Access Management
### Verified digital identities
`identity_verification.go` records citizen or corporate metadata alongside attestation hashes, supporting stringent KYC/AML requirements for wallet creation and contract interaction.

### Biometric authentication
`biometric_security_node.go` and `biometrics_auth.go` introduce fingerprint, facial, or voice signatures that are bound to identity tokens. Biometric factors restrict high‑risk actions—such as validator slashing or treasury withdrawals—to authenticated actors only.

### Regulatory oversight
`regulatory_management.go`, `compliance_management.go`, and `compliance.go` encode jurisdictional policies, sanction lists, and transaction ceilings. Each action generates an immutable audit trail, giving regulators and auditors direct insight into policy enforcement.

### Delegated roles and recovery
`access_control.go` and wallet logic in `wallet.go` allow enterprises to assign granular roles, rotate keys, or revoke access without halting operations. Recovery workflows ensure lost credentials can be replaced while preserving evidentiary chains.

## AI‑Powered Automation
### Model marketplace and lifecycle
`ai_model_management.go`, `ai_training.go`, and `ai_secure_storage.go` coordinate training pipelines, encrypted model storage, and royalty distribution for algorithms exchanged through the network’s marketplace. Provenance data captured on‑chain provides full lifecycle traceability.

### Anomaly and drift monitoring
`anomaly_detection.go` and `ai_drift_monitor.go` evaluate network metrics, gas trends, and validator behaviour to flag deviations from expected patterns. Alerts can trigger automatic rate limiting or consensus reconfiguration to maintain service levels.

### Intelligent contracts
`ai_enhanced_contract.go` embeds inference engines that adjust contract outcomes based on real‑time inputs—such as risk scores or market sentiment—without requiring centralised administrators.

### Predictive financial intelligence
`financial_prediction.go` and `ai_inference_analysis.go` generate market forecasts and scenario simulations. Insights from these models inform algorithmic trading, treasury hedging, and liquidity provisioning strategies.

## Data and Content Distribution
### Content addressing and replication
`content_node.go`, `data_distribution.go`, and `content_node_impl.go` govern how datasets are chunked, catalogued, and replicated. The approach balances locality and redundancy so enterprises can meet data residency mandates without sacrificing resilience.

### Zero‑trust data channels
`zero_trust_data_channels.go` establishes per‑channel keys and signature verification. Combined with `access_control.go`, it enables compartmentalised sharing where each recipient can independently verify provenance and integrity.

### Operational telemetry
`system_health_logging.go` and `indexing_node.go` collect performance metrics, event logs, and ledger indexes. These feeds drive dashboards and forensic analyses, supplying regulators and internal auditors with verifiable records.

### Content classification and lifecycle
`content_types.go` and `data_operations.go` apply schema validation, policy tags, and retention schedules to datasets. Integration with `ai_inference_analysis.go` enables automated classification and moderation pipelines for media or document workflows.

## Environmental and Energy Monitoring
### Energy efficiency tracking
`energy_efficiency.go` aggregates kilowatt‑hour usage per validator and cross‑references transaction throughput, enabling corporate ESG teams to report carbon cost per operation.

### Environmental sensor nodes
`environmental_monitoring_node.go` ingests field sensor data—such as air quality or temperature readings—and commits summaries to the ledger, supporting carbon accounting and environmental compliance initiatives.

### Adaptive resource management
`data_resource_management.go` and `energy_efficient_node.go` dynamically adjust storage, bandwidth, and computational quotas. Enterprises can therefore minimise environmental impact while sustaining peak workloads.

### Carbon credit accounting
Smart contracts such as `smart-contracts/solidity/SustainabilityScore.sol` tokenise emission offsets while `energy_efficiency.go` records consumption baselines. Combined, organisations can automate carbon credit issuance and reconciliation.

## Supply Chain and IoT Applications
### Asset traceability
`geospatial_node.go` and ledger primitives link GPS coordinates to asset identifiers, giving manufacturers and logistics firms provable custody trails from origin to destination.

### Sensor-driven workflows
`environmental_monitoring_node.go` and oracle contracts like `smart-contracts/solidity/WeatherOracle.sol` feed temperature, humidity, or shock data into smart contracts that trigger insurance payouts, compliance flags, or maintenance orders.

## Governance and Community Programmes
### Authority and validator governance

## Conclusion
Through its expansive feature set, the Synnergy Network empowers stakeholders to craft bespoke distributed solutions with verifiable security, sustainable operations, and cross‑jurisdictional compliance. Blackridge Group Ltd continues to evolve the platform so organisations can confidently deploy mission‑critical infrastructure on a foundation that scales from pilot projects to global ecosystems.

## Virtual Machine

# Virtual Machine

## Overview
The Synnergy Virtual Machine (SVM) is the execution backbone of Blackridge Group Ltd.'s blockchain ecosystem. It provides a deterministic environment for running WebAssembly-based smart contracts, ensuring that every node evaluates transactions with identical results. The SVM's design emphasises modularity, resource efficiency and security so that the platform can support applications ranging from high-throughput financial services to lightweight mobile interactions.

## Execution Model
At its core, the SVM interprets contracts encoded as sequences of 24-bit opcodes. Each opcode maps to a handler function responsible for transforming input bytes into new state. Unknown instructions default to a no-operation echo handler, keeping execution deterministic even when the opcode set evolves. Execution is driven through `ExecuteContext(ctx, wasm, method, args, gasLimit)` so callers can provide a cancellation context, raw opcode stream, optional method hint, initial arguments and a maximum gas allowance.

The virtual machine lifecycle is straightforward:

1. **Start** – initialise internal resources and mark the instance as running.
2. **Execute** – interpret bytecode, dispatching each opcode in sequence while accounting for gas consumption and respecting context cancellation.
3. **Stop** – release resources when the instance is no longer required.
4. **Status** – expose whether the engine is currently active.

This lifecycle conforms to the `VirtualMachine` interface used by the contract registry, enabling different VM implementations to be swapped without affecting higher-level modules or external tooling.

## Resource Profiles
To serve diverse deployment scenarios, the SVM supports three resource profiles identified in code as `VMHeavy`, `VMLight` and `VMSuperLight`:

- **Heavy** – allows up to ten concurrent executions for authority nodes or data centres that handle significant throughput.
- **Light** – the default profile permitting five parallel executions, suitable for general-purpose validator nodes.
- **Super Light** – serialises execution to a single request at a time, optimised for constrained environments such as mobile clients.

Profiles are enforced through a buffered channel that acts as a concurrency limiter. Calls exceeding capacity immediately return "vm busy", giving operators predictable back-pressure and preventing resource exhaustion.

## Instruction Encoding and Opcode Registry
Opcode words are big-endian 24-bit values, yielding over sixteen million possible instructions. Opcode `0x000000` is reserved for a default NOP/echo handler used whenever a specific code is unassigned. The registry `SNVMOpcodes` ships with handlers for all core modules—covering artificial intelligence tooling, cross-chain workflows, token economics and node operations. Developers can bind additional behaviour at runtime through `RegisterOpcode`, allowing the ecosystem to evolve without rebuilding the VM.

Key properties of the opcode system include:

- **Deterministic Defaults** – unrecognised codes route to an echo handler, ensuring repeatable execution across versions.
- **Modular Coverage** – every network service registers its operations, enabling a single bytecode stream to orchestrate cross-cutting features.
- **Extensibility** – runtime registration permits domain‑specific opcodes and experimental features without destabilising existing contracts.

## Opcode Catalogue and Inter-module Coverage
The opcode catalogue acts as a connective tissue across the Synnergy Network. Thousands of opcodes are pre-registered, giving bytecode the ability to drive:

- **AI and Analytics** – model publication, fraud prediction and baseline drift monitoring.
- **Cross-chain Bridges** – lock–mint and burn–release flows, sidechain registration and Plasma exits.
- **Token and Identity Management** – minting, staking, compliance checks and wallet operations.
- **Node Infrastructure** – provisioning mining, staking, light and watchtower nodes, alongside system health logging and firewall rules.
- **Governance and Compliance** – KYC validation, risk scoring and regulatory audit trails.
- **Security Services** – firewall configuration, biometric enrolment and zero‑trust data channels.

Because each opcode resolves to a handler within the registry, contracts orchestrate these disparate services without embedding network-specific logic. This modularity also allows Blackridge Group Ltd. to introduce new capabilities simply by registering additional opcodes.

## Lifecycle and Thread Safety
The SVM is engineered for concurrent workloads. Internally, a read/write mutex guards lifecycle transitions so `Start` and `Stop` can be invoked repeatedly without race conditions. Each execution acquires a token from a buffered channel sized according to the chosen profile, ensuring that no more than the allowed number of contracts run simultaneously. This pattern delivers predictable throughput while preserving determinism across validator implementations.

## Detailed Execution Flow
When `ExecuteContext` is called, the VM:

1. Validates that the instance is running and that bytecode is present.
2. Reserves a slot in the concurrency limiter, respecting any context cancellation during the wait.
3. Calculates the gas requirement based on the number of 24‑bit opcodes and checks it against the supplied limit.
4. Iterates through the bytecode three bytes at a time, resolving each opcode to a registered handler or the default echo function.
5. Aggregates the output of each handler as the new state.
6. Introduces a deterministic one‑millisecond delay before returning to align timing across nodes.

This deterministic flow means that any validator executing the same bytecode with the same inputs will arrive at the same output and gas usage.

## Gas Accounting and Cost Management
The SVM measures gas as the number of opcodes executed, with a minimum charge of one unit to cover empty payloads. For fine-grained pricing, the `GasTable` maps mnemonic names to explicit costs, loaded lazily from `docs/reference/gas_table_list.md` via a thread-safe cache. Runtime functions allow:

- **Lookup** – `GasCost` retrieves the fee for a given opcode name, returning a `DefaultGasCost` when unknown.
- **Validation** – `HasOpcode` verifies that a cost is defined.
- **Dynamic Pricing** – `RegisterGasCost` injects new fees and `ResetGasTable` clears cached values so tests and tooling can model evolving economics.

All operations are guarded by mutexes and instrumented with OpenTelemetry spans and structured JSON logs, keeping fee calculation transparent while preserving deterministic execution across nodes.

## Sandbox Management
For additional isolation, the Synnergy platform employs a sandbox manager that provisions dedicated execution environments for smart contracts. Each sandbox tracks:

- **Identifier and Contract Address** – unique references for managing instances.
- **Gas and Memory Limits** – execution boundaries that prevent contracts from monopolising resources.
- **Lifecycle Timestamps** – creation and last-reset times for auditability.

The manager exposes thread-safe operations to start, stop, reset and delete sandboxes, alongside queries for individual status or a complete inventory. By recording creation and reset timestamps, operators can audit lifecycle events and periodically recycle environments to enforce policy or reclaim resources.

Administrative tooling can query `SandboxStatus` for targeted inspection or `ListSandboxes` for a network-wide view, enabling fleet oversight and automated maintenance scripts.

## Error Handling and Recovery
Clear error semantics aid debugging and resilience. Typical responses include:

- **"vm not running"** when execution is attempted before `Start`.
- **"vm busy"** if the concurrency limiter is saturated.
- **"bytecode required"** for empty payloads.
- **"gas limit exceeded"** when estimated cost surpasses the caller's allowance.
- Propagated context cancellations and handler-specific failures.

These messages provide actionable insight, allowing operators to distinguish between transient contention and genuine contract faults.

## Observability and Auditability
Enterprise deployments require deep insight into runtime behaviour. The SVM and its supporting utilities emit structured JSON logs through an internal logger and expose OpenTelemetry tracing hooks. Gas table loading and opcode execution can therefore be correlated across nodes, while sandbox timestamps and reset events provide an auditable trail for compliance reviews.

## Integration with Synnergy Network
The contract registry relies on the SVM for every deployment and invocation. By abstracting execution behind the `VirtualMachine` interface, other modules—such as cross-chain bridges, data services and token registries—invoke contracts without needing to understand low-level execution details. The opcode table also binds many system functions, allowing the VM to orchestrate actions across the wider Synnergy Network in a uniform manner.

## Security and Determinism
Blackridge Group Ltd. designs the SVM with several safeguards:

- **Context-aware Execution** – operations honour cancellation signals, ensuring stalled calls do not linger during network disruptions.
- **Concurrency Limits** – resource profiles shield nodes from overload and deliberate denial-of-service attempts.
- **Deterministic Delay** – a fixed millisecond pause at the end of each run aligns timing across nodes and reduces timing-based side channels.
- **Graceful Error Handling** – empty payloads, gas overflows or saturated concurrency queues return descriptive errors while unknown opcodes fall back to the default handler.

## Enterprise Integration and Deployment
Because contracts compile to WebAssembly, developers can author logic in any language with a WASM toolchain while maintaining deterministic behaviour on the network. Dynamic opcode and gas registration allow phased rollouts of new modules, and profile-driven concurrency controls let operators tune resource usage for diverse hardware tiers. Combined with structured logging, telemetry and sandbox auditing, these capabilities equip Blackridge Group Ltd. with a production-ready execution layer suitable for mission-critical applications.

## Use Cases and Deployment Scenarios
- **Authority Nodes** leverage the heavy profile to process large batches of transactions and complex contract interactions.
- **Validator Nodes** typically run the light profile, balancing responsiveness with resource usage.
- **Edge and Mobile Clients** utilise the super light profile to verify or execute small workloads without draining local resources.

In all cases, the unified VM architecture ensures that applications behave consistently regardless of where they run within the Synnergy Network.

## Conclusion
The Synnergy Virtual Machine delivers a robust, extensible and resource-aware execution layer for the platform's smart contracts. Through its opcode-driven design, sandbox management, observability stack and multiple performance profiles, the SVM embodies Blackridge Group Ltd.'s commitment to secure and scalable decentralised computing.

## Wallet

# Wallet

Blackridge Group Ltd.’s Synnergy Network wallet is the primary interface for creating, securing and authorizing value on-chain. It combines hardened cryptography with flexible tooling so developers, institutions and end users can transact confidently across the ecosystem.

## Cryptographic Foundation
- **Key Generation:** Each wallet is built on an ECDSA key pair derived from the P-256 curve. The public key is hashed with SHA-256 and truncated to 20 bytes, yielding a 40-character hexadecimal address that uniquely identifies the account on-chain【F:core/wallet.go†L26-L41】.
- **Signature Workflow:** Transactions are hashed and signed using the wallet’s private key. Counterparties verify the signature against the signer’s public key, ensuring non-repudiation and tamper resistance【F:core/wallet.go†L44-L68】.

## Secure Key Storage
- **Encrypted Wallet Files:** Private keys can be written to disk using AES‑256 GCM encryption with an `scrypt`-derived key. The process stores the address, salt, nonce and ciphertext, safeguarding the wallet against offline attacks【F:core/wallet.go†L71-L108】.
- **Recovery and Portability:** Encrypted files are reopened with the correct passphrase, reconstituting the P-256 key pair and address so wallets can move between environments without exposing secrets【F:core/wallet.go†L111-L150】.

## Genesis Allocation and Auditing
Synnergy’s genesis event pre-allocates funds to well-known roles using deterministic addresses derived from hashed labels. These genesis wallets cover internal development, charity initiatives, loan pools, validator rewards and more, enabling transparent auditing from day one【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L8-L41】. Fee inflows can then be programmatically split across those addresses by `AllocateToGenesisWallets`, which maps the network’s distribution policy to concrete wallet targets【F:core/genesis_wallets.go†L44-L58】【F:core/fees.go†L101-L108】.

Operational scripts such as `mainnet_setup.sh` exercise this model by generating distribution, reserve and treasury wallets and computing initial allocations before nodes are launched【F:scripts/mainnet_setup.sh†L25-L40】.

## Interfaces and Tooling
### Command-Line Interface
The `synnergy` CLI includes a `wallet` module for deterministic wallet creation. Operators can output an encrypted file and specify the encryption password at generation time, enabling scripted provisioning and secure backups【F:cli/wallet.go†L8-L34】.

Unit tests assert that the command emits JSON with a 40‑character address and writes the encrypted wallet to disk, providing a safety net for automated pipelines【F:cli/wallet_cli_test.go†L9-L30】.

### Wallet Server
A lightweight HTTP service exposes `/health` and `/wallet/new` endpoints. The server uses the core wallet library to generate addresses on demand and returns them as JSON, allowing GUIs or external tooling to request wallets without direct key management【F:walletserver/handlers.go†L15-L33】【F:walletserver/main.go†L9-L18】.

Handler tests cover both endpoints to ensure consistent responses and proper error handling before the service is deployed【F:walletserver/handlers_test.go†L10-L35】.

### GUI and Test Harness
Integration tests demonstrate a GUI-driven workflow where the wallet server issues addresses, the CLI validates them and transactions are signed end-to-end. These tests ensure every interface remains interoperable across releases【F:tests/gui_wallet_test.go†L39-L72】.

## Funding and Test Networks
New wallets can be seeded without manual token transfers through a rate‑limited faucet. The core faucet tracks balances, dispense amounts, cooldowns and per‑address timestamps to prevent abuse【F:core/faucet.go†L9-L56】. Operators initialise and interact with the faucet via CLI commands for setup, requests, balance checks and configuration updates, enabling rapid developer onboarding【F:cli/faucet.go†L13-L83】. Unit tests validate cooldown enforcement and configuration changes to ensure predictable behaviour during network bootstrapping【F:core/faucet_test.go†L8-L24】.

## Identity and Compliance
Regulated deployments often require wallets to be tied to verified identities. The `IDRegistry` component records metadata for wallet addresses, allowing applications to confirm registration status before granting privileges【F:idwallet_registration.go†L8-L44】. The `idwallet` CLI wraps this registry so operators can register and query identity-tagged wallets at the command line【F:cli/idwallet.go†L13-L44】, with an accompanying automation stub ready for integration into onboarding workflows【F:scripts/idwallet_register.sh†L1-L17】.

Fee schedules further reinforce governance; `FeeForWalletVerification` estimates the cost of higher assurance checks so compliance programs can budget accurately【F:core/fees.go†L84-L88】. For sanctioned or compromised accounts, the network-wide firewall can block wallet addresses, tokens or peer IPs in real time, and an accompanying CLI allows operators to list, allow or block IPs on demand【F:firewall.go†L5-L44】【F:cli/firewall.go†L13-L58】.

## Advanced Custody Models
For high-value accounts, Synnergy supports multisignature authorisation through a Solidity `MultisigWallet` contract where owners submit, approve and execute transactions once a quorum is met【F:smart-contracts/solidity/MultisigWallet.sol†L4-L59】. The repository also lays groundwork for session-key and smart contract-based wallets, with templates that will expand into programmable spending policies【F:smart-contracts/solidity/SessionKeyWallet.sol†L1-L6】【F:smart-contracts/solidity/SmartWallet.sol†L1-L6】. Automation stubs are provided to bootstrap multisignature setups in deployment scripts, allowing enterprises to codify approval flows【F:scripts/wallet_multisig_setup.sh†L1-L17】.

## Enterprise Automation
The repository includes a suite of shell scripts that automate key lifecycle tasks such as initialization, rotation, multisignature configuration, offline signing and hardware wallet integration. These utilities provide a foundation for institutional policy enforcement and cold‑storage workflows【F:scripts/wallet_init.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/wallet_key_rotation.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/wallet_multisig_setup.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/wallet_offline_sign.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/wallet_hardware_integration.sh†L1-L17】. Additional stubs prepare automated wallet server deployments and end‑to‑end mainnet bootstraps where CLI tools create distribution wallets and compute genesis allocations【F:scripts/wallet_server_setup.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/mainnet_setup.sh†L19-L40】.

## Deployment and Operations
Production environments can run the wallet server as a replicated Kubernetes deployment with resource quotas and health probes. The `wallet.yaml` manifest provisions two pods from the `synnergy/walletserver` image, exposes port 8081, mounts configuration and defines readiness and liveness endpoints for self-healing clusters【F:deploy/k8s/wallet.yaml†L1-L67】. This operational blueprint enables horizontal scaling and consistent lifecycle management across cloud providers.

## Verification and Test Coverage
Comprehensive tests validate wallet functionality at every layer. Core tests confirm address uniqueness, signature integrity and encrypted file round‑trips【F:core/wallet_test.go†L8-L56】. CLI tests verify that `wallet new` outputs valid JSON and persists encrypted keys【F:cli/wallet_cli_test.go†L9-L30】, while server tests exercise the HTTP endpoints for health checks and wallet generation【F:walletserver/handlers_test.go†L10-L35】. Integration tests drive the server and CLI together to mirror a production GUI workflow【F:tests/gui_wallet_test.go†L39-L72】.

## Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords for encrypted wallet files and store them separately from key backups.
- Rotate keys periodically and leverage multisignature arrangements for high-value accounts.
- Employ offline signing or hardware wallets when operating in adversarial environments.
- Register wallets with the identity registry when operating under compliance regimes.
- Apply firewall rules to block sanctioned or suspicious addresses.

By combining robust cryptography, layered security controls and a spectrum of automation tools, the Synnergy wallet empowers organizations to interact with the Blackridge Group Ltd. blockchain confidently while meeting stringent operational and regulatory requirements.

## compliance and audit system

# Compliance and Audit System

**Blackridge Group Ltd.** delivers an enterprise-grade compliance and auditing framework for the Synnergy Network. The system blends deterministic virtual machine execution with granular policy controls to ensure regulatory adherence, transparent operations and forensic-grade logging across every component.

## 1. Core Compliance Service
The `ComplianceService` orchestrates know-your-customer (KYC) data, fraud signals and risk scores while maintaining immutable audit trails. Internally it employs thread-safe maps and structured logging so validators can scale without race conditions:

- **KYC validation and erasure** – hashes incoming documents, stores commitments and supports secure removal while emitting structured logs【F:core/compliance.go†L55-L78】
- **Fraud detection and risk scoring** – appends severity-weighted signals, updates cumulative risk and records metadata-rich audit entries【F:core/compliance.go†L80-L90】
- **Audit trail retrieval** – returns copies of per-address event histories for investigators, preserving the original records from mutation【F:core/compliance.go†L101-L108】
- **Transaction anomaly monitoring** – tracks transaction IDs, flags threshold breaches and logs anomalies for post‑mortem analysis【F:core/compliance.go†L111-L124】
- **Zero‑knowledge proof verification** – verifies commitments without disclosing underlying data, preserving confidentiality during compliance checks【F:core/compliance.go†L127-L132】

## 2. Identity Verification Framework
A dedicated `IdentityService` records verified identity metadata and verification attempts, enabling enterprises to associate KYC artifacts with on-chain accounts:

- Stores name, date of birth and nationality for registered addresses and rejects duplicates【F:identity_verification.go†L37-L45】
- Records every verification method with timestamped logs for auditing provenance of identity checks【F:identity_verification.go†L48-L56】
- Exposes read‑only APIs for retrieving identity records and verification histories【F:identity_verification.go†L60-L75】

## 3. Role‑Based Access Control
Internal services employ an RBAC layer to gate privileged actions and capture authorization attempts:

- `RBAC` maintains roles, permissions and user assignments using concurrent maps【F:internal/auth/rbac.go†L8-L66】
- `PolicyEnforcer` checks permissions and records JSON‑formatted audit entries through an injectable `AuditLogger`【F:internal/auth/rbac.go†L88-L109】【F:internal/auth/audit.go†L10-L39】

## 4. Address Control and Whitelisting
The `ComplianceManager` enforces policy actions on addresses:

- Suspend or resume transfers for flagged entities
- Maintain whitelists to override suspensions for approved addresses
- Review outbound transactions before broadcast, blocking those involving suspended parties

These functions operate through mutex‑protected maps and transaction review logic, enabling rapid policy updates without network downtime【F:compliance_management.go†L30-L78】.

## 5. Regulatory Enforcement Layer
To accommodate jurisdictional rules, Blackridge Group Ltd. provides a modular regulatory suite:

- `RegulatoryManager` stores regulations with identifiers, jurisdictions and maximum transaction thresholds, returning all violations for a proposed transfer【F:regulatory_management.go†L8-L75】
- `RegulatoryNode` uses the manager to approve or reject transactions and records reasons in per-address logs for auditors【F:regulatory_node.go†L8-L49】

This separation of policy definition and enforcement allows different regions to apply bespoke rules while preserving a unified network codebase.

## 6. Audit Infrastructure
Network integrity is monitored by dedicated audit components:

- `AuditManager` records timestamped events and retrieves histories in a tamper‑evident manner【F:core/audit_management.go†L9-L60】
- `AuditNode` couples a bootstrap node with the manager, exposing start, log and list operations for compliance teams【F:core/audit_node.go†L5-L49】
- `StdAuditLogger` writes JSON‑formatted authorization logs for forensic analysis and external SIEM ingestion【F:internal/auth/audit.go†L10-L39】

## 7. Streaming Anomaly Detection
A lightweight `AnomalyDetector` provides statistical outlier detection for streaming metrics and transaction amounts. Using Welford’s method for incremental mean and variance, it flags values exceeding configurable z‑score thresholds without storing raw histories【F:anomaly_detection.go†L8-L49】.

## 8. Deterministic Opcode and Gas Accounting
The Synnergy Virtual Machine assigns fixed opcodes to all compliance, identity and audit functions, ensuring deterministic execution paths. Complementary gas table entries price each operation so wallets can display fee impacts:

- Opcodes cover compliance managers, KYC validation, audit logging, identity services and RBAC checks【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L37-L149】
- Gas table documentation explicitly prices reward, supply and KYC operations to make policy enforcement economically transparent【F:gas_table.go†L18-L36】

## 9. Command‑Line Ecosystem
Administrators interact with the framework through structured CLI tools:

- `synnergy compliance` – validate KYC, erase records, record fraud, assess risk, view audit trails, monitor transactions and verify ZKPs【F:cli/compliance.go†L30-L166】
- `synnergy compliance_management` – suspend, resume, whitelist, unwhitelist and review transactions at the address level【F:cli/compliance_mgmt.go†L28-L85】
- `synnergy regulator` and `synnergy regnode` – manage regulations, approve transactions and inspect regulatory logs【F:cli/regulatory_management.go†L12-L53】【F:cli/regulatory_node.go†L12-L33】
- `synnergy audit` and `synnergy audit_node` – append and retrieve audit events locally or via a bootstrap‑aware audit node【F:cli/audit.go†L14-L65】【F:cli/audit_node.go†L21-L80】
- `synnergy identity` – register identity metadata, record verification methods and inspect associated logs【F:cli/identity.go†L12-L59】

## 10. Automation and Tooling
Shell utilities streamline common workflows:

- `compliance_setup.sh` provisions initial KYC commitments via the CLI【F:scripts/compliance_setup.sh†L1-L12】
- `compliance_audit.sh` and `compliance_rule_update.sh` reserve hooks for policy audits and ruleset migrations, providing a template for production automation【F:scripts/compliance_audit.sh†L1-L17】【F:scripts/compliance_rule_update.sh†L1-L17】

## 11. Monitoring Dashboards
An enterprise-grade React/TypeScript dashboard visualises compliance metrics and integrates linting, testing and containerised deployment for operational teams【F:GUI/compliance-dashboard/README.md†L1-L30】.

## 12. End‑to‑End Workflow Example
1. **Provision KYC:** run `compliance_setup.sh mykyc.json` to hash and store commitments.
2. **Suspend Malicious Actor:** invoke `synnergy compliance_management suspend badaddr` and optionally whitelist exceptions.
3. **Enforce Regulation:** define a rule via `synnergy regulator add AML1 US "AML Threshold" 1000` and let `synnergy regnode approve` gate outbound transfers.
4. **Log and Review:** auditors execute `synnergy audit log addr event key=value` and export histories for oversight.
5. **Identity Assurance:** regulatory officers query `synnergy identity info addr` to validate the subject of investigation.

## 13. Security and Forensics
Immutable audit trails, granular address controls and deterministic opcodes enable real‑time monitoring and post‑incident reconstruction. JSON logging aligns with external SIEM pipelines, while zero‑knowledge verification and RBAC auditing preserve confidentiality without compromising oversight.

## 14. Zero‑Trust Data Channels
`ZeroTrustEngine` establishes encrypted channels anchored by ephemeral Ed25519 keys to isolate sensitive payloads. Messages are symmetrically encrypted, signed, stored and later verified before decryption, allowing investigators to prove integrity without exposing plaintext【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L24-L66】【F:zero_trust_data_channels.go†L82-L102】.

## 15. Watchtower Monitoring and Health Logging
`WatchtowerNode` pairs a node‑level firewall with continuous health sampling to surface forks and resource anomalies. Metrics collected include goroutine counts, memory usage, peer totals and last block height, all emitted on a ten‑second cadence for operational dashboards【F:watchtower_node.go†L13-L68】【F:system_health_logging.go†L11-L40】. Dedicated opcodes bind these monitoring routines to deterministic VM execution【F:snvm._opcodes.go†L44-L75】.

## 16. Transaction Governance and Reversals
Advanced transaction controls enable deferred execution, cancellation and authority‑mediated reversals. Scheduled transactions can be cancelled before execution, while reversal requests freeze funds and require a quorum of authority votes before compensation is applied【F:core/transaction_control.go†L15-L106】.

## 17. Private Transactions and Receipts
AES‑GCM wrappers convert transactions into encrypted payloads and later decrypt them for authorized parties. Every processed transaction generates a searchable receipt, supporting audit queries across status, identifier or free‑form metadata【F:core/transaction_control.go†L116-L210】.

## 18. Firewall Enforcement
A lightweight `Firewall` maintains concurrent blocklists for addresses, token identifiers and peer IPs. Rules can be added or removed at runtime, giving compliance teams immediate network‑level quarantine capabilities that integrate with watchtower nodes and policy engines【F:firewall.go†L5-L88】.

## ai architecture

# AI Architecture

## Overview
The AI subsystem enables smart contracts and nodes to incorporate machine learning capabilities. It covers model training, secure storage, on-chain inference and ongoing drift detection so deployed models remain trustworthy.

## Key Modules
- `ai_training.go` – orchestrates offline model training and records checksums.
- `ai_model_management.go` – tracks registered models and owners.
- `ai_enhanced_contract.go` – wraps WebAssembly models for deterministic contract calls.
- `ai_inference_analysis.go` – executes inference requests and returns results to the VM.
- `ai_secure_storage.go` – encrypts model artifacts and wipes them after execution.
- `ai_drift_monitor.go` – compares live predictions against baselines to flag drift.

## Workflow
1. **Train** models off-chain and register the hash through `ai_training`.
2. **Store** artifacts using `ai_secure_storage` so only authorized nodes can access them.
3. **Deploy** via `synnergy ai_contract deploy` which binds the model hash to a contract.
4. **Infer** when transactions invoke the contract; `ai_inference_analysis` loads the model and meters gas.
5. **Monitor** using `ai_drift_monitor` which triggers alerts or retraining when accuracy degrades.

## Security Considerations
- Model files remain encrypted at rest and are scrubbed from disk after use.
- All inference requests are gas metered and validated to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Drift and anomaly events can route to the broader anomaly detection system for investigation.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy ai_contract` – deploy, invoke and inspect AI‑enhanced contracts.
- `synnergy ai_model` – list registered models and associated hashes.

## ai marketplace architecture

# AI Marketplace Architecture

## Overview
The AI Marketplace serves as a lightweight web interface for deploying AI‑enhanced smart contracts on the Synnergy Network. Rather than re‑implementing the full blockchain stack in the browser, the GUI acts as a guided wrapper around the `synnergy ai_contract deploy` command. This design keeps the web surface area small while still giving developers an approachable way to publish models.

## Component Layers
- **User Interface** – A React/TypeScript single page application that collects the WebAssembly module, model hash, manifest and gas limit. The form validates basic requirements such as file type, hash length and numeric ranges before enabling deployment.
- **CLI Adapter** – The browser passes the validated artifacts to a small Node service that shells out to the Synnergy CLI. The adapter streams stdout and stderr back to the UI so users can observe progress in real time.
- **Synnergy CLI** – Handles signing, consensus interaction and virtual machine integration. Because the CLI manages keys locally, the marketplace avoids exposing private keys to the browser.
- **Result Parser** – Once the CLI returns, the adapter extracts the contract address and returns it to the front‑end for display or further interaction.

## Deployment Workflow
1. **Package preparation** – Developers compile their model into WebAssembly and generate a manifest describing inputs, expected outputs and gas requirements.
2. **Upload and validation** – The user selects the module and manifest in the GUI. Client‑side validation checks file size limits and ensures the hash in the manifest matches the uploaded artifact.
3. **CLI execution** – The adapter writes the files to a temporary directory and invokes `synnergy ai_contract deploy --wasm <file> --manifest <file> --gas <limit>`.
4. **Network confirmation** – The CLI broadcasts the transaction and waits for inclusion in a block. Progress is streamed to the UI so the user can cancel or retry if necessary.
5. **Address delivery** – On success, the resulting contract address is displayed and stored for quick access from the marketplace.

## Data and Storage
- Uploaded artifacts are kept only long enough to complete deployment and are deleted after confirmation to avoid lingering sensitive data.
- Future iterations may integrate an artifact registry so popular models can be reused without re‑uploading large binaries.

## Security Considerations
- **No in‑browser keys** – All signing occurs within the CLI, eliminating the risk of key theft through the web layer.
- **Strict validation** – Both client and adapter validate manifest fields, file sizes and command arguments to prevent command injection or resource exhaustion.
- **Rate limiting** – The adapter can throttle requests per user to discourage denial‑of‑service attacks.
- **Audit logging** – Every deployment request and CLI response is logged with a request identifier, providing traceability for governance or billing.

## Future Enhancements
- Marketplace listings that allow developers to publish and monetize their models after deployment.
- Integration with on‑chain inference services so contracts can call models hosted by third parties.
- Richer progress reporting, including estimated gas costs and block confirmations.
- Hooks for community review and governance to vet models before they become discoverable.

This architecture prioritizes simplicity and security while leaving room for the marketplace to grow into a full ecosystem for AI contracts.

## compliance architecture

# Compliance and Regulatory Architecture

## Overview
Compliance components ensure network activity adheres to legal and policy requirements. They provide audit trails, sanction screening and tools for regulators to review transactions without halting decentralized operation.

## Key Modules
- `compliance.go` – core checks for sanctioned addresses and suspicious transfers.
- `compliance_management.go` – aggregates reports and exposes review APIs.
- `regulatory_management.go` – coordinates rulesets from multiple jurisdictions.
- `regulatory_node.go` – special node type that can request logs and attest to audits.

## Workflow
1. **Policy ingestion** – `regulatory_management` loads jurisdictional rules and feeds them to compliance services.
2. **Transaction evaluation** – `compliance` hooks into validation to screen participants before blocks finalize.
3. **Reporting** – flagged events are persisted by `compliance_management` for later inspection.
4. **Regulatory access** – authorized `regulatory_node` instances can query logs and sign off on reviews.

## Security Considerations
- Access to compliance reports is gated through `access_control` and logged for traceability.
- Regulatory nodes operate read-only paths and cannot alter ledger state.
- Rulesets are versioned so historical decisions can be reconstructed during audits.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy compliance` – run ad-hoc checks and view current rulesets.
- `synnergy compliance-mgmt` – manage reports and export audit logs.

## consensus architecture

# Consensus Architecture

## Overview
Consensus modules decide how blocks are produced and agreed upon across heterogeneous nodes. The system can hop between proof‑of‑work, proof‑of‑stake and proof‑of‑history modes based on live network conditions.

## Key Modules
- `dynamic_consensus_hopping.go` – selects an optimal consensus mode from metrics.
- `core/consensus` components – manage difficulty, validator sets and block validation.
- `consensus_service.go` – runs mining services that participate in block production.
- `consensus_specific_node.go` – locks a node into a fixed mode when required by policy.
- `consensus_adaptive_management.go` – adjusts weights used for dynamic mode selection.

## Workflow
1. **Metrics collection** – nodes feed latency and stake data to `dynamic_consensus_hopping`.
2. **Mode evaluation** – the hopper chooses a consensus mode and informs validators.
3. **Block production** – the `consensus_service` mines or validates blocks according to the selected mode.
4. **Difficulty adjustment** – core consensus utilities recalculate thresholds to maintain target block times.
5. **Validator management** – `validator_management` registers, slashes or rewards participants.

## Security Considerations
- Mode switches require thresholds to prevent rapid oscillation and potential exploits.
- Validator slashing protects against double-signing or extended downtime.
- Availability checks ensure no single mode becomes a bottleneck during network splits.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy consensus` – inspect weights, adjust parameters and view thresholds.
- `synnergy consensus-service` – start or stop a mining service.
- `synnergy consensus-node` – create a node fixed to a particular mode.
- `synnergy consensus-adaptive` – query and tune adaptive management weights.

## cross chain architecture

# Cross-Chain Architecture

## Overview
Cross-chain components allow the Synnergy Network to interoperate with external blockchains. Bridges, connection managers and protocol adapters move assets and data while preserving deterministic execution.

## Key Modules
- `cross_chain_bridge.go` – coordinates locked assets and releases across chains.
- `cross_chain_connection.go` – maintains authenticated links to foreign networks.
- `cross_chain_contracts.go` – wraps remote contract calls with verification steps.
- `cross_chain_transactions.go` – queues and relays transactions between networks.
- `cross_chain_agnostic_protocols.go` – standardizes message formats for different chains.

## Workflow
1. **Connection setup** – `cross_chain_connection` establishes authenticated channels to target networks.
2. **Asset locking** – `cross_chain_bridge` escrows tokens and emits proofs of lock.
3. **Relay** – authorized relayers submit proofs to the destination chain where assets are minted or released.
4. **Contract execution** – `cross_chain_contracts` verify the proof and invoke remote logic.
5. **Finalization** – `cross_chain_transactions` record the result and update local ledgers.

## Security Considerations
- Relayers are whitelisted and their actions logged to prevent spoofed messages.
- Bridges verify proofs using light-client techniques and reject malformed data.
- Rate limits and size checks protect against flooding the relay queues.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy cross-chain` – manage bridge operations and relay status.
- `synnergy cross-chain-connection` – configure endpoints and authorizations.
- `synnergy cross-chain-bridge` – lock, release and verify assets.

## dao explorer architecture

# DAO Explorer Architecture

## Overview
The DAO Explorer gives stakeholders a streamlined view into decentralized governance activity. It wraps the `dao` CLI commands with a lightweight web interface so users can create organisations, stake tokens and vote on proposals without managing raw JSON outputs.

## Key Modules
- `cli/dao.go` – top-level command wiring together proposal, staking and token subcommands.
- `cli/dao_proposal.go` – create, list and execute governance proposals.
- `cli/dao_staking.go` – manage staking balances that grant voting power.
- `cli/dao_quadratic_voting.go` – apply quadratic weighting to cast votes.
- `core/dao_proposal.go` – in-memory store for proposals and results.

## Workflow
1. **Organisation discovery** – the explorer lists DAOs by shelling out to `synnergy dao list`.
2. **Proposal creation** – users draft proposals which `dao_proposal` submits to the core manager.
3. **Staking** – `dao_staking` records token deposits and exposes balances.
4. **Voting** – votes are cast through `dao_quadratic_voting` to mitigate whales.
5. **Execution** – successful proposals trigger follow‑up actions such as parameter changes or fund dispersal.

## Security Considerations
- The explorer operates in read‑only mode for most queries, keeping private keys in the CLI layer.
- Proposal and vote submissions require signatures from staking accounts.
- All transactions are logged with proposal IDs to maintain an auditable trail.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy dao` – entry point for DAO operations.
- `synnergy dao-proposal` – manage proposals.
- `synnergy dao-stake` – deposit or withdraw staking amounts.

## docker architecture

# Deployment and Container Architecture

## Overview
Docker images provide a reproducible environment for running Synnergy nodes, wallets and supporting services. Multi‑stage builds compile Go binaries and produce small runtime images that can be orchestrated with Compose or Kubernetes.

## Components
- **Dockerfiles** – each major service has a dedicated Dockerfile with build and runtime stages.
- **docker-compose.yml** – orchestrates local clusters for development and testing.
- **Entrypoint scripts** – scripts in `cmd/scripts/` configure nodes before startup.

## Workflow
1. **Build** – the Dockerfile compiles binaries and bundles configuration defaults.
2. **Package** – artifacts are copied into a minimal base image to reduce attack surface.
3. **Run** – containers expose required ports and volumes for keys and data directories.
4. **Compose orchestration** – `docker-compose.yml` links nodes, wallets and dashboards for quick demos.

## Security Considerations
- Images drop privileges to non‑root users where possible.
- Only necessary binaries and configuration files are included in the runtime stage.
- Environment variables and secrets can be injected at run time rather than baked into the image.

## CLI Integration
Containers typically invoke the `synnergy` binary directly; additional helper scripts can bootstrap networks via Compose.

## explorer architecture

# Explorer Architecture

## Overview
The Explorer provides read‑only insight into ledger state and network activity. A small TypeScript frontend shells out to the `synnergy` CLI to fetch blocks, transactions and account balances.

## Key Components
- **Frontend** – SPA built with TypeScript that renders tables and charts.
- **CLI Adapter** – Node layer that executes commands like `synnergy ledger head` and `synnergy tx show`.
- **Indexing node** – optional backend using `indexing_node.go` for faster queries.

## Workflow
1. The user requests a block or account view in the browser.
2. The adapter runs the appropriate CLI command and captures structured JSON output.
3. Results are parsed and displayed with minimal processing.

## Security Considerations
- The explorer only performs read operations; signing keys never leave the node.
- Rate limits on the adapter protect nodes from heavy scraping.
- Content security policy headers restrict external scripts in the frontend.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy ledger` – retrieve block headers and history.
- `synnergy tx` – inspect transaction details.

## governance architecture

# Governance and DAO Architecture

## Overview
Governance modules enable token holders to shape network parameters through proposals and voting. They integrate closely with DAO tooling and staking mechanisms to ensure decisions reflect economic weight while remaining transparent.

## Key Modules
- `core/dao_proposal.go` – stores proposals and tracks execution state.
- `internal/governance/replay_protection.go` – prevents duplicate submissions and replays.
- `core/authority_nodes.go` – manages elected authority nodes responsible for executing decisions.
- `cli/dao_token.go` – issues governance tokens such as `syn300`.
- `cli/dao_access_control.go` – manages membership and permissions within DAOs.

## Workflow
1. **Token distribution** – governance tokens like `syn300` are minted and distributed.
2. **Proposal creation** – stakeholders draft proposals via `synnergy dao-proposal`.
3. **Staking and voting** – `dao-stake` records locked tokens and voting power.
4. **Execution** – approved proposals trigger operations such as parameter changes or fund transfers managed by authority nodes.

## Security Considerations
- Replay protection ensures proposals cannot be submitted multiple times for the same block.
- Authority nodes validate proposal authenticity before executing changes.
- Governance actions are immutable and recorded on the ledger for accountability.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy dao-token` – mint and manage governance tokens.
- `synnergy dao-proposal` – create and review proposals.
- `synnergy dao-stake` – manage staking balances.

## identity access architecture

# Identity and Access Architecture

## Overview
Identity services provide secure onboarding and fine‑grained access control. They issue identity tokens, manage credential proofs and enforce permissions across nodes and smart contracts.

## Key Modules
- `identity_verification.go` – validates user documents and links them to on-chain identities.
- `idwallet_registration.go` – registers identity wallets and stores public keys.
- `access_control.go` – checks permissions for CLI commands and contract calls.
- `biometrics_auth.go` – optional biometric login for high-assurance nodes.
- `biometric_security_node.go` – dedicated node for processing biometric templates.

## Workflow
1. **Registration** – users submit credentials processed by `identity_verification`.
2. **Wallet issuance** – `idwallet_registration` creates identity wallets and issues SYN900 tokens.
3. **Permission assignment** – roles are defined and enforced by `access_control`.
4. **Authentication** – nodes may request biometric factors via `biometrics_auth` for sensitive operations.

## Security Considerations
- Personal data is hashed or encrypted before storage.
- Biometric templates are processed on specialized nodes and never leave secure memory.
- Access control checks are logged to detect misuse or privilege escalation.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy idwallet` – register identity wallets.
- `synnergy access` – manage roles and permissions.

## kubernetes architecture

# Kubernetes Architecture

## Overview
Kubernetes manifests enable scalable deployments of Synnergy components in cluster environments. They describe desired state for nodes, dashboards and auxiliary services, allowing automated rollout and recovery.

## Components
- **Deployment manifests** – under `deploy/k8s/` for authority nodes, explorers and dashboards.
- **Services** – expose gRPC and HTTP endpoints within the cluster.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets** – inject node configuration and keys at runtime.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers** – optionally adjust validator or dashboard replicas based on metrics.

## Workflow
1. Apply manifests with `kubectl` or through CI pipelines.
2. Kubernetes schedules pods and mounts ConfigMaps/Secrets containing network settings.
3. Services route traffic to healthy pods; failed instances are restarted automatically.
4. Autoscalers monitor CPU or custom metrics to add or remove replicas.

## Security Considerations
- Secrets are mounted as temporary volumes and not baked into images.
- NetworkPolicies can restrict pod communication to required ports.
- Role Based Access Control governs who may apply or modify manifests.

## CLI Integration
While Kubernetes handles orchestration, containers still invoke the `synnergy` CLI for node operations.

## loanpool architecture

# Loanpool Architecture

## Overview
Loanpool modules administer community lending pools that issue grants or loans to participants. Authority nodes review applications and the smart contract enforces repayment terms.

## Key Modules
- `cli/loanpool.go` – high level operations for creating and funding pools.
- `cli/loanpool_apply.go` – submit loan or grant applications.
- `cmd/scripts/loanpool_apply.sh` – example script for automating submissions.
- `core` loanpool routines integrated via opcodes for contract execution.

## Workflow
1. **Pool creation** – authority nodes initialize pools and set parameters.
2. **Application** – users apply through `loanpool_apply` specifying amount and purpose.
3. **Review** – authority nodes evaluate applications and approve or reject.
4. **Disbursement** – approved loans are released through on-chain transactions.
5. **Repayment tracking** – the contract monitors payments and can trigger penalties for defaults.

## Security Considerations
- Authority node actions are logged and require multi-signature approval.
- Applications are validated to prevent duplicate submissions.
- Loan terms are immutable once the contract is deployed.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy loanpool` – create pools and manage funding.
- `synnergy loanpool-apply` – submit or review applications.

## monitoring logging architecture

# Monitoring and Logging Architecture

## Overview
Observability components provide operators with insight into node health and network conditions. Logging utilities stream structured events while watchtower nodes monitor peers for outages or malicious behaviour.

## Key Modules
- `system_health_logging.go` – emits metrics and health events.
- `watchtower_node.go` – monitors peer availability and reports anomalies.
- `anomaly_detection.go` – analyses logs for suspicious patterns.

## Workflow
1. **Event capture** – nodes call `system_health_logging` to record resource usage and errors.
2. **Watchtower aggregation** – `watchtower_node` collects peer heartbeats and cross-checks logs.
3. **Alerting** – anomalies trigger alerts or automated responses such as node isolation.

## Security Considerations
- Logs omit sensitive data and can be encrypted when transported.
- Watchtower queries use authenticated channels to prevent spoofing.
- Rate limiting ensures logging cannot be used to exhaust disk space.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy watchtower` – manage watchtower nodes.
- `synnergy logs` – stream or filter system logs (via `system_health_logging`).

## nft marketplace architecture

# NFT Marketplace Architecture

## Overview
The NFT marketplace allows creators to mint and trade tokens representing unique assets. It reuses the core token and contract systems, exposing a browser interface that wraps the `nft_marketplace` CLI.

## Key Modules
- `core/nft_marketplace.go` – in-memory catalogue and trade execution logic.
- `cli/nft_marketplace.go` – create listings, buy and sell NFTs.
- `smart-contracts/nft_minting.wasm` – sample contract template for minting.
- GUI under `GUI/nft_marketplace` – React frontend for user interaction.

## Workflow
1. **Minting** – creators deploy the `nft_minting.wasm` template via the contracts CLI.
2. **Listing** – `nft_marketplace` registers the token with price and owner information.
3. **Purchase** – buyers invoke the CLI or GUI to transfer ownership atomically.
4. **Catalogue update** – the marketplace updates its in-memory index and broadcasts events.

## Security Considerations
- Listings reference on-chain token IDs to prevent spoofing.
- Trades execute atomically to avoid partial transfers.
- The marketplace can enforce whitelists or royalties via smart contract hooks.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy nft-marketplace` – manage listings and execute trades.

## node operations dashboard architecture

# Node Operations Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
The Node Operations Dashboard aggregates metrics from authority and validator nodes to give operators a single view of network health. It combines a TypeScript frontend with REST endpoints exposed by nodes and watchtower services.

## Key Components
- `GUI/node-operations-dashboard` – frontend that renders charts and status tables.
- Node status endpoints provided by authority nodes.
- `watchtower_node.go` – feeds health information to the dashboard.

## Workflow
1. **Data collection** – nodes expose JSON endpoints with uptime, block height and peer counts.
2. **Aggregation** – the dashboard polls these endpoints and normalizes results.
3. **Visualization** – operators view charts, alerts and logs through the GUI.

## Security Considerations
- Dashboard requests are read-only and can be gated behind authentication.
- TLS is recommended for all endpoints to prevent tampering.
- Rate limits stop the dashboard from overwhelming nodes during polling.

## CLI Integration
- Operators can script status checks using `synnergy watchtower` and feed output into the dashboard.

## node roles architecture

# Node Roles Architecture

## Overview
Synnergy defines several specialized node types to fulfill distinct responsibilities, from content distribution to regulatory oversight. Each role implements tailored logic while sharing common networking and consensus layers.

## Example Roles
- `content_node.go` – serves application data and handles content type registration.
- `indexing_node.go` – builds searchable indexes for the explorer and analytics tools.
- `regulatory_node.go` – interfaces with compliance modules to provide audit capabilities.
- `watchtower_node.go` – observes peer health and reports anomalies.
- `mobile_mining_node.go` – lightweight miner suited for resource‑constrained devices.

## Workflow
Nodes advertise their role during handshake, enabling peers to route requests appropriately. Shared services such as consensus and storage remain consistent, while role-specific modules extend functionality.

## Security Considerations
- Role capabilities are limited by `access_control` to prevent privilege escalation.
- Specialized nodes may run in isolated environments or networks depending on sensitivity.
- Heartbeat checks from watchtower nodes help detect compromised or offline roles.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy indexing-node` – manage indexing services.
- `synnergy watchtower` – administer watchtower nodes.
- `synnergy regulatory-node` – access regulatory functions.

## security architecture

# Security Architecture

## Overview
Security modules protect the network from malicious actors and data leakage. Layers range from firewalls and anomaly detection to private transactions and zero‑trust data channels.

## Key Modules
- `firewall.go` – filters inbound and outbound traffic based on configurable rules.
- `anomaly_detection.go` – analyses behaviour to detect attacks or protocol violations.
- `private_transactions.go` – obfuscates transaction details for confidential transfers.
- `zero_trust_data_channels.go` – encrypts inter-node communication with rotating keys.
- `biometric_security_node.go` – handles biometric verification for high-security environments.

## Workflow
1. **Traffic filtering** – `firewall` evaluates connection attempts before peers are admitted.
2. **Runtime monitoring** – `anomaly_detection` inspects logs and metrics for irregularities.
3. **Secure communication** – nodes exchange data through `zero_trust_data_channels` ensuring end-to-end encryption.
4. **Confidential execution** – `private_transactions` process sensitive transfers with limited disclosure.

## Security Considerations
- Firewall rules and anomaly thresholds are versioned and auditable.
- Zero-trust channels rotate keys to limit exposure from compromised peers.
- Private transaction modules enforce gas limits to mitigate spam.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy firewall` – manage firewall rules.
- `synnergy private-tx` – create and inspect private transactions.
- `synnergy anomaly` – review detected anomalies.

## smart contract marketplace architecture

# Smart-Contract Marketplace Architecture

## Overview
The smart-contract marketplace lets developers publish and trade reusable WebAssembly contracts. It leverages the existing contract registry and virtual machine so uploaded bytecode executes with the same determinism and gas accounting as native contracts.

## Key Modules
- `cli/contracts.go` – deploys templates and manages marketplace listings.
- `smart-contracts/templates` – collection of example contracts available for reuse.
- Core contract registry routines accessed through opcodes.

## Workflow
1. **Template selection** – developers pick a template or upload custom WASM bytecode.
2. **Deployment** – `synnergy contracts deploy` registers the contract and stores metadata.
3. **Listing** – optional marketplace listing makes the contract discoverable to others.
4. **Invocation** – consumers use standard contract calls; gas usage is tracked by the VM.

## Security Considerations
- Uploaded bytecode is validated and sandboxed by the virtual machine.
- Listings reference immutable hashes so users receive the expected code.
- Gas limits prevent runaway execution and are surfaced in CLI output.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy contracts` – deploy, list and remove marketplace contracts.

## specialized architecture

# Specialized Features Architecture

## Overview
Certain modules provide niche or experimental capabilities that extend the core platform. These features target specialized industries or research use cases and are isolated from critical consensus paths.

## Example Modules
- `geospatial_node.go` – processes location-aware data for mapping or logistics applications.
- `environmental_monitoring_node.go` – records sensor data for sustainability tracking.
- `financial_prediction.go` – runs predictive models for market analysis.
- `holographic.go` – explores holographic data visualisation techniques.
- `energy_efficient_node.go` – optimizes mining for low-power hardware.

## Workflow
Specialized nodes register their capabilities and expose APIs relevant to their domain. Other services can query them for enriched data or analytics without impacting consensus throughput.

## Security Considerations
- These modules are optional and can be disabled in high-security deployments.
- Data produced by specialized nodes may require separate validation or calibration.
- Resource usage is monitored to ensure experimental features do not exhaust network capacity.

## CLI Integration
Relevant features expose dedicated CLI commands such as `synnergy geospatial-node` or `synnergy energy-node` depending on the module.

## storage architecture

# Storage and Data Architecture

## Overview
Storage components handle data persistence, distribution and secure retrieval for contracts and nodes. They support off-chain resources, encrypted storage and marketplace mechanisms for sharing datasets.

## Key Modules
- `data_distribution.go` – replicates data across nodes for redundancy.
- `data_resource_management.go` – tracks dataset metadata and ownership.
- `data_operations.go` – provides read/write primitives with access checks.
- `ai_secure_storage.go` – encrypts sensitive model artifacts.
- Storage marketplace GUI and contracts for trading dataset access.

## Workflow
1. **Registration** – datasets are registered via `data_resource_management` with hashes and permissions.
2. **Distribution** – `data_distribution` propagates chunks to approved nodes.
3. **Access** – contracts call `data_operations` to read or mutate data; checks ensure caller permissions.
4. **Marketplace** – optional marketplace contracts allow leasing or selling access to datasets.

## Security Considerations
- All data operations require permission checks and are logged.
- Encryption keys are stored separately and rotated regularly.
- Distribution routines verify integrity using content hashes.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy data` – manage resources, distribution and access policies.

## tokens transactions architecture

# Tokens and Transactions Architecture

## Overview
This architecture governs token standards, contract execution and the lifecycle of transactions on the Synnergy Network. It ensures interoperability among numerous SYN token variants and maintains deterministic gas accounting.

## Key Modules
- Token implementations under `internal/tokens/` such as `syn20`, `syn200`, `syn300` and others.
- `contracts.go` and `contracts_opcodes.go` – manage contract deployment and invocation.
- `cross_chain_transactions.go` – relays transactions across networks.
- `gas_table.go` – records gas costs for operations.

## Workflow
1. **Token creation** – CLI commands like `synnergy syn20` mint standard tokens.
2. **Transaction assembly** – clients construct transactions referencing token contracts and desired methods.
3. **Execution** – the virtual machine runs opcodes from `contracts_opcodes.go` and charges gas from `gas_table`.
4. **Cross-chain relay** – `cross_chain_transactions` forwards messages to other networks when required.

## Security Considerations
- Token standards include allowance checks to prevent unauthorized transfers.
- Gas accounting protects nodes from infinite loops or heavy computation.
- Cross-chain operations require relayer authorization and proof verification.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy syn20`, `synnergy syn200`, etc. – manage specific token standards.
- `synnergy tx` – build and broadcast transactions.

## virtual machine architecture

# Virtual Machine Architecture

## Overview
The Synnergy Virtual Machine (SVM) executes WebAssembly smart contracts in a deterministic, resource‑constrained environment. It supports sandboxed execution, opcode metering and context-aware timeouts.

## Key Modules
- `virtual_machine.go` – core VM implementation handling instruction dispatch and gas metering.
- `vm_sandbox_management.go` – creates and tears down sandboxes for contract calls.
- `snvm._opcodes.go` – opcode table mapping functions to gas costs.
- `contracts_opcodes.go` – exposes opcodes for contract deployment and invocation.

## Workflow
1. **Instantiation** – the VM spins up a sandbox with defined memory and time limits.
2. **Execution** – opcodes from the contract are interpreted; gas usage is tracked in `gas_table.go`.
3. **Completion** – `vm_sandbox_management` cleans up memory and returns results.
4. **Snapshotting** – gas table snapshots can be written for analysis or billing.

## Security Considerations
- Sandboxes prevent contracts from accessing host resources directly.
- Timeouts stop runaway code and free resources for other transactions.
- Opcodes are versioned to ensure deterministic behaviour across nodes.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy vm` – inspect VM settings and manage snapshots.

## wallet architecture

# Wallet Architecture

## Overview
Wallet tooling provides key management and transaction capabilities for end users. A thin GUI wraps the `synnergy` CLI while a `walletserver` backend can broker requests for web or mobile clients.

## Key Components
- **CLI wallet commands** – generate keys, sign transactions and export encrypted JSON keystores.
- **walletserver** – lightweight HTTP server that forwards signed transactions to the network.
- **GUI wallet** – Electron/React interface that shells out to the CLI.

## Workflow
1. **Key generation** – users create wallets via the CLI which stores keys locally.
2. **Transaction building** – the GUI or server constructs transactions and requests signatures from the CLI.
3. **Broadcast** – signed transactions are submitted to nodes through the wallet server or directly via the CLI.
4. **Backup** – keys can be exported as encrypted JSON for cold storage.

## Security Considerations
- Keys never leave the user's machine unencrypted.
- Scrypt-derived keys with AES‑GCM encryption protect keystores at rest.
- The wallet server operates without access to private keys, reducing compromise risk.

## CLI Integration
- `synnergy wallet` – generate keys and sign transactions.
- `walletserver` binary – run an API-compatible backend for remote clients.

## charity guide

# Charity Pool Guide

The charity module coordinates donations and community voting for registered
charitable organisations. Funds are deposited into a shared pool and, on a
regular cycle, distributed to the charities that receive the most support from
token holders.

## Features

- **Deposits** – Any address can transfer tokens into the pool account
  `charity_pool`.
- **Registration** – Charities register an address, human‑readable name and a
  category describing their mission.
- **Voting** – Holders of SYN900 identity tokens may vote for a charity once per
  cycle. Votes are persisted to the ledger for auditability.
- **Payouts** – At the end of a cycle the pool can distribute a portion of its
  balance to the top voted charities. The current implementation stores votes
  and registrations; payout logic is left to future work.

## Categories

Charities self‑identify using one of the predefined categories in
`core/charity.go`:

| ID | Category |
|----|----------|
| `1` | HungerRelief |
| `2` | ChildrenHelp |
| `3` | WildlifeHelp |
| `4` | SeaSupport |
| `5` | DisasterSupport |
| `6` | WarSupport |

Additional categories can be added by extending the `CharityCategory` enum.

## CLI Usage

The `synnergy` CLI exposes helper commands under `charity_pool` for interacting
with the module. These commands use an in‑memory ledger so they can be run
without a full node.

### Register a Charity

```bash
synnergy charity_pool register <address> <category> <name>
```

Registers a charity with the given address and human‑readable name. The
`<category>` argument is one of the numeric identifiers listed above.

### Vote for a Charity

```bash
synnergy charity_pool vote <voter_addr> <charity_addr>
```

Records a vote from `voter_addr` to `charity_addr`. Only one vote per cycle is
counted for each voter.

### Deposit to the Pool

```bash
synnergy charity_pool deposit <from> <amount>
```

Transfers tokens from `from` into the shared pool account. Deposits accumulate
until a payout is triggered.

### Query Winners

```bash
synnergy charity_pool winners <cycle>
```

Returns the list of winning charities for a given cycle. The current prototype
returns an empty list until distribution logic is implemented.

## Integrating the Pool

Applications may instantiate the pool in code using:

```go
led := ... // implements core.StateRW
electorate := ... // implements IsIDTokenHolder
cp := core.NewCharityPool(logger, led, electorate, genesisTime)
```

The `StateRW` interface provides ledger access. `electorate` is used to validate
whether a voter holds an identity token. `genesisTime` defines the start of the
first voting cycle.

## Future Work

The current module is intentionally lightweight. Planned enhancements include:

- Automatic calculation of payout cycles and distribution of pool funds.
- On‑chain governance to add or remove categories.
- Richer query APIs for analytics and historical reporting.

Contributions and design proposals are welcome via pull requests.

## synnergy

Synnergy blockchain CLI

Stage 38 finalises biometric security and associated CLI modules. Wallet and
biometric commands are now fully tested and hardened, enabling secure
configuration and automation in production environments. Stage 40 adds
robust block management with strict argument validation and accompanying test
coverage.
Stage 43 introduces DAO governance commands with optional JSON output and
signature verification utilities for secure organisational workflows. Membership
updates through `dao-members` now require valid ECDSA signatures before roles
change, ensuring authenticated governance actions.

```bash
# List all pools with reserves
synnergy liquidity_views list

# Inspect a specific pool
synnergy liquidity_views info <id>
```

## Smart contract tests

Stage 44 introduces a contract test harness ensuring templates deploy correctly through the CLI and virtual machine. Run:

```bash
go test ./tests/contracts
```

to validate the token faucet template and future contract modules.

## Kubernetes deployment
Stage 48 adds manifests under `deploy/k8s/` for running the node and wallet
server inside a Kubernetes cluster. Apply them with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/node.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/wallet.yaml
```

These manifests include health probes and resource limits so clusters can
maintain availability automatically.

### Node Operations Dashboard CLI

The `node-operations-dashboard` module provides a lightweight CLI accessed with `npm start` to view node health status.

### System Analytics Dashboard CLI

The `system-analytics-dashboard` module supplies TypeScript utilities for collecting and serving metrics.

```bash
cd GUI/system-analytics-dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

Tests and lint checks can be run with `npm test` and `npm run lint` respectively.

## config guide

# Synnergy Configuration Guide

This document describes how to configure a Synnergy node using the YAML files in `cmd/config/`. The configuration loader merges `default.yaml` with an optional environment specific file identified by the `SYNN_ENV` variable. Applications should call `config.LoadFromEnv()` which implements this behaviour. All values can be overridden by environment variables thanks to Viper's `AutomaticEnv` integration and the project `.env` file.

## Loading Sequence

1. `default.yaml` is loaded first and establishes sane defaults for development.
2. If `SYNN_ENV` is set (for example `prod` or `bootstrap`) a file with the same name is merged in.
3. Environment variables are then applied. Keys use dot notation matching the YAML structure (e.g. `network.max_peers`).
4. The resulting configuration is unmarshaled into the `Config` struct defined in `pkg/config/config.go` and made available as `config.AppConfig`.

Running the CLI without `SYNN_ENV` uses only the default settings which are safe for local testing.

## Configuration Structure

Every YAML file shares the same schema shown below. Each section is described in detail in the following subsections.

```yaml
network:
  id: synnergy-mainnet
  chain_id: 1215
  max_peers: 50
  genesis_file: config/genesis.json
  rpc_enabled: true
  p2p_port: 30303
  listen_addr: "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001"
  discovery_tag: synnergy-mesh
  bootstrap_peers: []

consensus:
  type: pos
  block_time_ms: 3000
  validators_required: 3

vm:
  max_gas_per_block: 8000000
  opcode_debug: false

storage:
  db_path: ./data/db
  prune: true

logging:
  level: info
  file: logs/synnergy.log
```

### `network`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Human friendly identifier for the network. Appears in logs and the genesis file. |
| `chain_id` | Integer identifier used when signing transactions. Nodes on different chain IDs will refuse to connect. |
| `max_peers` | Maximum number of simultaneous peer connections. |
| `genesis_file` | Path to the genesis block JSON. This file defines the initial state, balances and validator set. |
| `rpc_enabled` | Enables the JSON-RPC server when `true`. |
| `p2p_port` | TCP port for libp2p communications. |
| `listen_addr` | Full multiaddress the node listens on. |
| `discovery_tag` | Rendezvous string used during peer discovery. |
| `bootstrap_peers` | List of static peers to dial on startup. |

### `consensus`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | Name of the consensus algorithm (`pos` by default). |
| `block_time_ms` | Target block interval in milliseconds. |
| `validators_required` | Minimum number of validators that must sign a block. |

### `vm`

Configuration for the embedded virtual machine.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `max_gas_per_block` | Maximum total gas that can be consumed by all transactions in a block. |
| `opcode_debug` | When `true`, logs every opcode executed—useful for debugging contracts. |

### `storage`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `db_path` | Directory where the node stores its local database files. |
| `prune` | If enabled, old states are pruned to save disk space. |

### `logging`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `level` | Log verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). |
| `file` | Optional file path for log output. If empty, logs go to stdout. |

## Environment Files and Overrides

The repository contains a `.env` file with additional variables such as API endpoints and secrets. `config.Load` reads these values automatically so they can override YAML fields. Typical variables include `API_BIND`, `GOVERNANCE_API_ADDR`, and `JWT_SECRET`. When running in production make sure to provide secure values for any secrets.

## Example Configurations

- **default.yaml** – Used for local development. RPC is enabled and the node listens on all interfaces.
- **prod.yaml** – Starting point for production deployments. Values generally mirror `default.yaml` but can be customised by setting `SYNN_ENV=prod`.
- **bootstrap.yaml** – Template for a dedicated bootstrap node. It sets `discovery_tag` to `synnergy-bootstrap`, typically raises `max_peers`, and omits `bootstrap_peers` so other nodes connect to it first.

## Genesis Block

The genesis file referenced by `network.genesis_file` establishes the very first block in the chain. The sample `genesis.json` included in this repository looks like:

```json
{
  "genesis_time": "2025-07-09T12:00:00Z",
  "chain_id": "synnergy-mainnet",
  "initial_balances": {
    "0xABC...": 1000000000,
    "0xDEF...": 500000000
  },
  "validators": [
    { "address": "0x123...", "stake": 1000000 }
  ]
}
```

At start-up the ledger reads this file and creates the first block with the specified balances and validator set. Adjust the addresses and amounts to suit your deployment. The `chain_id` must match the value under `network.chain_id`.

## Creating a New Configuration

1. Copy `default.yaml` to a new file name such as `staging.yaml`. An example `staging.yaml` is included in this repository for release candidate testing.
2. Modify any fields required for your environment—commonly the `genesis_file` path and `bootstrap_peers`.
3. Set `SYNN_ENV=staging` before running the `synnergy` binary.
4. Optionally create or edit a `.env` file to supply secrets and service endpoints.
5. Use `../scripts/staging_validate.sh` to spin up the staging network and run a sample token transfer.

## Conclusion

The configuration system is intentionally simple: a layered YAML approach backed by environment variables. By editing these files and the genesis block you can tailor a Synnergy deployment for local testing, dedicated bootstrap nodes or a full production network.

## API Version

The configuration loader API is currently versioned as **v0.1.0**. Future changes will follow semantic versioning guidelines.

## consensus guide

# Consensus Guide

Synnergy employs a hybrid consensus engine that blends Proof‑of‑Work (PoW),
Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS) and Proof‑of‑History (PoH). The weights assigned to each
mechanism adjust dynamically according to network conditions so the chain can
favour security, throughput or decentralisation as required.

## Core Concepts

The implementation lives in `core/consensus.go` and related files. Key data
structures include:

- **ConsensusWeights** – percentage weight for PoW, PoS and PoH. Weights always
  sum to `1.0`.
- **SynnergyConsensus** – stateful engine that holds the current weights and
  tuning parameters used for transitions.

### Weight Adjustment

`AdjustWeights(D, S)` recalculates the internal weights based on network demand
`D` and stake concentration `S`. An adjustment factor `Gamma` smooths changes and
ensures no algorithm falls below a minimum floor unless unavailable. The method
normalises the weights after applying availability flags:

```go
sc.AdjustWeights(currentDemand, currentStake)
```

### Transition Threshold

The engine exposes helper functions to compute thresholds for switching
strategies:

- `Tload(D)` – influence of current network load.
- `Tsecurity(threat)` – impact of observed security threats.
- `Tstake(S)` – influence of stake concentration.
- `TransitionThreshold(D, threat, S)` – combined threshold used to decide when
  to adjust weights.

### Adaptive Management

Stage 63 introduces the `AdaptiveManager` which keeps a sliding window of recent
demand and stake metrics. Methods like `RecordMetrics` store observations while
`Adjust` and `Threshold` operate on the averaged values, smoothing sudden swings
in network behaviour.

### Difficulty Adjustment

PoW difficulty adjusts according to the time it took to mine the previous window
of blocks:

```go
newDiff := sc.DifficultyAdjust(oldDiff, actualTime, expectedTime)
```

### Validator Selection

For PoS rounds validators are selected randomly in proportion to their stake:

```go
next := sc.SelectValidator(stakeMap)
```

The function returns the address of the chosen validator or an empty string if
no stakes are present.

## CLI Interaction

Consensus parameters can be inspected and tuned via the `consensus` command
group once the `synnergy` CLI is built. Common operations include starting the
service, viewing current weights and simulating difficulty adjustments. See the
CLI help output for a full list of subcommands.

Stage 41 expands these tools with a `connpool release` command for freeing network connections and a `contractopcodes` helper that reports gas costs for contract operations, allowing operators to budget resources during tuning.

## Extending the Engine

The consensus package is designed for experimentation. Potential extensions
include:

- Integrating additional consensus mechanisms such as BFT replicas.
- Persisting weight history for audit and visualisation.
- Adding metrics to track how often transitions occur.

Contributors are encouraged to document significant changes in an Architecture
Decision Record under `docs/adr/`.

## developer guide

# Synnergy Network

Synnergy is a research blockchain exploring modular components for
decentralised finance, data storage and AI‑powered compliance.  It is written in
Go and ships a collection of command line utilities alongside the core
libraries.  The project focuses on extensibility rather than production
readiness.  Further background can be found in [`WHITEPAPER.md`](../../WHITEPAPER.md).

The primary entrypoint is the `synnergy` binary which exposes a large set of
sub‑commands through the
[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) framework. Development helpers in
`core/helpers.go` allow the CLI to operate without a full node while modules are
implemented incrementally.

## Key Features

- **Modular architecture** – each blockchain capability lives in its own Go
  package and can be enabled or disabled independently.
- **AI enhanced compliance** – optional machine learning modules analyse
  transactions for risk and assist with on‑chain regulation.
- **Cross‑chain communication** – bridges, rollups and consensus hopping modules
  allow assets to move between networks and adapt to different environments.
- **Advanced governance** – quadratic voting, DAO tooling and reputation systems
  support enterprise decision making.
- **Extensive GUI suite** – wallet, explorers and marketplaces provide rich web
  interfaces backed by REST services.
- **Structured CLI output** – contract and audit commands emit JSON and return
  errors, easing automation and integration with external dashboards.

## Role-based Financial Controls

- Authority nodes register with dedicated wallets and receive unique job keys
  for decrypting randomly assigned governance tasks.
- LoanPool grants distribute 5% of each payout to five selected authority
  wallets. Proposals require concurrent approval from authority and public
  voters to pass.
- ID tokens remain inactive until validated by an authority node, preventing
  double voting across governance systems.
- Only **Central Bank** nodes may deploy the SYN‑10/11/12 token standards.
- Regulated instruments such as ETFs, bonds and real‑estate tokens may only be
  issued by Government, Regulator, Creditor Bank or Central Bank nodes. Bill
  tokens are limited to creditor nodes while benefit tokens are exclusive to the
  government.
- Monetary and fiscal controls on SYN‑10/11/12 tokens are reserved for the
  government role and cannot be applied elsewhere.
- Regulator nodes can initiate security upgrades but final activation requires a
  community vote for decentralised acceptance.

## Directory Layout

The repository is organised as follows:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `core/` | Core blockchain modules such as consensus, storage, networking and smart contract logic. See [`module_guide.md`](module_guide.md) for a file-by-file summary. |
| `cmd/cli/` | CLI command implementations using Cobra. Each file registers a command group. |
| `cmd/config/` | Default YAML configuration files and schema documentation. |
| `cmd/synnergy/` | Entry point for the `synnergy` binary and network setup walkthroughs. |
| `cmd/scripts/` | Shell helpers for common development tasks. See [`script_guide.md`](script_guide.md). |
| `cmd/smart_contracts/` | Example WebAssembly contracts bundled with the CLI. |
| `scripts/` | Top-level scripts to start local devnets or testnets. |
| `tests/` | Go unit tests covering each module. Run with `go test ./...`. |
| `GUI/` | Web front-ends including `wallet`, `explorer`, `ai-marketplace` and more. |
| `walletserver/` | Go HTTP backend powering the wallet GUI. |
| `internal/` | Shared utilities used across CLI and services. |
| `ai.proto` | gRPC definitions for AI-related services. |
| `smart_contract_guide.md` | Documentation and examples for writing contracts. |
| `third_party/` | Vendored dependencies such as a libp2p fork used during early development. |
| `setup_synn.sh` | Convenience script that installs Go and builds the CLI. |
| `Synnergy.env.sh` | Optional environment bootstrap script that downloads tools and loads variables from `.env`. |
| `../../WHITEPAPER.md` | Project vision and design goals. |

## Environment Setup

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.20 or newer and ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is on
   your `PATH`.
2. Clone the repository and download dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/synnergy_network/Synnergy.git
   cd Synnergy/synnergy-network
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Run `../setup_synn.sh` for a minimal toolchain or `../Synnergy.env.sh` for a
   full environment with additional dependencies and variables loaded from
   `.env`.
4. For GUI projects install Node.js 18+ and your preferred package manager.


## Building

Once the environment is prepared, compile the main binary from the repository
root:

```bash
cd synnergy-network
go build ./cmd/synnergy
```

The resulting binary `synnergy` can then be executed with any of the available
sub‑commands. Development stubs in `core/helpers.go` expose `InitLedger` and
`NewTFStubClient` so the CLI can run without a full node during testing.

The provided script `./setup_synn.sh` automates dependency installation and
builds the CLI.  For a fully configured environment with additional tooling and
variables loaded from `.env`, run `./Synnergy.env.sh` after cloning the
repository.

## Command Groups

Each file in `cmd/cli` registers its own group of commands with the root
`cobra.Command`. The main program consolidates them so the CLI surface mirrors
all modules from the core library. Highlights include:

- `ai` – publish models and run inference jobs
- `ai_contract` – manage AI enhanced contracts with risk checks
- `ai-train` – manage on-chain AI model training
- `ai_mgmt` – manage AI model marketplace listings
- `ai_infer` – advanced inference and transaction analysis
- `amm` – swap tokens and manage liquidity pools
- `authority_node` – validator registration and voting; each authority registers
  with a dedicated wallet address and activates after meeting voting thresholds
- `access` – manage role based access permissions
- `authority_apply` – submit and approve authority node applications
- `charity_pool` – query and disburse community funds
- `charity_mgmt` – manage donations and internal payouts
- `identity` – manage verified addresses
- `coin` – mint and transfer the native SYNN coin
- `compliance` – perform KYC/AML checks
- `audit` – manage on-chain audit logs

### Authority Node Policy

Authority nodes are specialised participants that oversee sensitive network
operations. When registering, each node must provide a wallet address for
payments and fees. Approval requires both public and authority votes to reach
configured thresholds. Their multi-signature approval is required for actions
like transaction reversals, loan pool authorisation and regulated token
issuance. Privileged roles – Government, Regulator, Creditor Bank and Central
Bank – restrict deployment of certain financial instruments and SYN‑10/11/12
tokens.
- `sandbox` – manage VM sandboxes
- `workflow` – automate multi-step tasks with triggers and webhooks
- `supply` – manage supply chain assets on chain
- `wallet` – mnemonic generation and signing
- `execution` – orchestrate block creation and transaction execution
- `regulator` – manage approved regulators and enforce rules
- `feedback` – submit and query user feedback
- `system_health` – monitor runtime metrics and write logs
- `idwallet` – register ID-token wallets and verify status
- `offwallet` – offline wallet utilities
- `recovery` – register and invoke account recovery
- `wallet_mgmt` – manage wallets and send SYNN directly via the ledger

Quadratic voting allows token holders to weight their governance votes by the
square root of the staked amount. The `qvote` command submits these weighted
votes and queries results alongside standard governance commands.

More details for each command can be found in `cli_guide.md`.

## Core Modules

The Go packages under `core/` implement the blockchain runtime. Key modules
include consensus, storage, networking and the virtual machine.  A summary of
every file is maintained in [`module_guide.md`](module_guide.md). New
contributors should review that document to understand dependencies between
packages.

## Configuration

Runtime settings are defined using YAML files in `cmd/config/`.  The CLI loads
`default.yaml` by default and merges any environment specific file if the
`SYNN_ENV` environment variable is set (for example `SYNN_ENV=prod`).
`bootstrap.yaml` provides a template for running a dedicated bootstrap node. You can launch it via `synnergy bootstrap start` and point other nodes to its address.
The configuration schema is documented in [`config_guide.md`](config_guide.md).

## Running a Local Network

Once the CLI has been built you can initialise a test ledger and start the core
services locally.  A detailed walk‑through is provided in
[`cmd/synnergy/synnergy_set_up.md`](cmd/synnergy/synnergy_set_up.md), but the
basic steps are:

```bash
synnergy ledger init --path ./ledger.db
synnergy network start &
synnergy wallet create --out wallet.json
synnergy coin mint $(jq -r .address wallet.json) 1000
```

By default the node attempts to open the listening port on your router using
UPnP or NAT‑PMP. You can inspect and manage these mappings with the new `nat`
command group.

Additional helper scripts live under `cmd/scripts`.  Running
`start_synnergy_network.sh` will build the CLI, launch networking, consensus and
other daemons, then run a demo security command.

Two top level scripts provide larger network setups:
`scripts/devnet_start.sh` spins up a local multi-node developer network, while
`scripts/testnet_start.sh` starts an ephemeral testnet defined by a YAML
configuration. Both build the CLI automatically and clean up all processes on
`Ctrl+C`.

## Scripts

Reusable shell helpers in `cmd/scripts` automate common tasks such as funding
accounts (`faucet_fund.sh`), deploying contracts (`contracts_deploy.sh`),
starting network services and more. The complete reference is available in
[`script_guide.md`](script_guide.md).

Top level scripts are provided for multi-node setups:

- `scripts/devnet_start.sh` – start a local developer network.
- `scripts/testnet_start.sh` – launch an ephemeral testnet from YAML.

## GUI Projects

Browser-based interfaces reside under `GUI/`:

- `wallet` – manage accounts using the `walletserver` backend.
- `explorer` – query balances and transactions.
- `ai-marketplace` – browse and purchase AI models.
- `smart-contract-marketplace` – deploy and trade contracts.
- `storage-marketplace` – pay for decentralized storage.
- `nft_marketplace` – create and trade NFTs.
- `dao-explorer` – interact with DAO governance.
- `token-creation-tool` – generate new tokens.
- `dex-screener` – view decentralized exchange listings.
- `authority-node-index` – monitor authority nodes.
- `cross-chain-management` – manage bridges and transfers.

The `walletserver/` directory contains the Go HTTP backend for the wallet GUI.

## Smart Contracts

Example contracts live throughout the repository and are documented in
[`smart_contract_guide.md`](smart_contract_guide.md). They demonstrate opcode
usage for token faucets, storage markets, DAO governance and more. Contracts are
compiled to WebAssembly and deployed via the `synnergy` CLI.

## Docker

A `Dockerfile` at the repository root allows running Synnergy without a local Go installation.
Build the image and start a node with:

```bash
docker build -t synnergy ..
docker run --rm -it synnergy
```

The container launches networking, consensus, replication and VM services automatically.

## Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests` directory and mirror the structure of the
`core` packages. For any code change run the standard toolchain:

```bash
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

Some modules depend on live services such as the network or security daemon.
Those tests may require additional environment variables or mock
implementations; consult the comments within each test file for setup
instructions.

## User Feedback and UX

Community input guides interface design across the project.

- Report usability and accessibility issues through the [UX Feedback issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ux_feedback.md), including environment details, user type and impact.
- Follow the [UX Feedback Guide](UX_FEEDBACK_GUIDE.md) for the feedback lifecycle, accessibility checklist and metrics.
- Issues are triaged weekly and outcomes are summarised in a monthly community call where priorities are set and metrics reviewed.

## Contributing

Development tasks are organised in stages described in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). When contributing code:

1. Work through the stages sequentially and modify no more than three files per
   commit or pull request.
2. Run `go fmt`, `go vet`, `go build` and `go test` on the packages you touch
   before committing.
3. Update any relevant documentation and cross-reference new features in this
   README or the module guide.
4. Mark completed files in `AGENTS.md` so others know which tasks are in
   progress.

Use the `setup_synn.sh` script when preparing a new environment; it installs
Go, fetches dependencies and builds the CLI.

## License

Synnergy is provided for research and educational purposes.  Third‑party
dependencies located under `third_party/` retain their original licenses.  Refer

# Synnergy Core Module Guide

The `core` directory contains the fundamental building blocks of the Synnergy
network.  Each Go source file defines an individual **module** that can usually
be compiled and tested in isolation.  Modules favour small, explicit
dependencies and generally only import `common_structs.go` for shared types.

This guide provides an expanded orientation for contributors who want to
understand or extend the runtime.  It groups related modules and highlights
their responsibilities, common interactions and supporting documentation.

## Directory Orientation

```
synnergy-network/
├─ core/                 # runtime modules (this guide)
├─ tests/                # accompanying unit and integration tests
└─ docs/                 # project wide documentation
```

The `tests` folder mirrors the structure of `core` and contains regression
tests for most modules.  When adding new functionality, create a matching test
file in `synnergy-network/tests`.

## Working With Modules

1. **Keep dependencies minimal.**  Import from `common_structs.go` and other
   utilities rather than coupling modules directly.
2. **Document behaviour.**  Exported types and functions should have GoDoc style
   comments.  This guide summarises intent but the source is authoritative.
3. **Add tests.**  Create or update a matching file under
   `synnergy-network/tests` and ensure `scripts/run_tests.sh` passes.
4. **Update documentation.**  If your change affects public APIs or gas costs,
   also update `docs/developer-guide.md` or `core/opcode_and_gas_guide.md` as
   appropriate.

## Testing and Validation

The repository provides a helper script to run the entire test suite:

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

This script invokes `go test` across the workspace and performs additional lint
checks.  Run it before submitting a pull request.

## Additional Resources

- `docs/developer-guide.md` – broader project conventions and workflow.
- `core/opcode_and_gas_guide.md` – reference for virtual machine opcodes and gas
  pricing.
- `synnergy-network/tests` – examples of how modules are exercised in practice.

## Contributing

Changes to modules should be accompanied by clear commit messages and tests.
Open a pull request describing the rationale and reference this guide when
adding new modules or altering existing ones.

## node guide

# Node Guide

This guide describes the node implementations available in the Synnergy project. Each node is a focused Go module that exposes a small API and can be composed with other components to build complex behaviour.

## Mining Node

The `MiningNode` simulates proof-of-work mining. It can start or stop hashing, submit block hashes, and attempt synchronous mining with adjustable difficulty. The node keeps minimal state so it can be used in tests and simulations.

**Key methods**
- `Start` / `Stop` – control the mining loop.
- `MineBlock` – mine a block at a specified difficulty.
- `SubmitBlock` and `LastBlock` – record and retrieve the most recently mined block.

## Mobile Mining Node

`MobileMiningNode` wraps a `MiningNode` and pauses mining when the device battery falls below a threshold.

**Key methods**
- `UpdateBattery` – record current battery level.
- `Start` – begin mining only when the battery is above the configured threshold.
- `SetThreshold` – adjust the minimum battery level required for mining.

## Staking Node

`StakingNode` tracks stakes for multiple addresses in memory.

**Key methods**
- `Stake` and `Unstake` – lock or release tokens.
- `Balance` – return the staked balance for an address.
- `TotalStaked` – amount staked across all participants.

## Indexing Node

`IndexingNode` offers a simple in-memory key/value index to speed up lookups of ledger data.

**Key methods**
- `Index` – insert or update entries.
- `Query` – fetch a value copy for a key.
- `Remove` – delete an entry.
- `Keys` and `Count` – enumerate the index.

## Content Network Node

`ContentNetworkNode` tracks content items hosted by a node, enabling resource discovery.

**Key methods**
- `Register` and `Unregister` – manage content availability.
- `Content` – fetch metadata for a specific item.
- `List` – return all registered content.

## Energy Efficient Node

`EnergyEfficientNode` records throughput and power usage for validators and can issue sustainability certificates.

**Key methods**
- `RecordUsage` – update processed transaction and energy metrics.
- `AddOffset` – credit carbon offsets.
- `Certify` – produce a `SustainabilityCertificate` summarizing efficiency.
- `ShouldThrottle` – report when efficiency drops below a threshold.

## Environmental Monitoring Node

`EnvironmentalMonitoringNode` evaluates sensor data against registered conditions and triggers actions when thresholds are met.

**Key methods**
- `SetCondition` – register sensor rules.
- `Trigger` – evaluate incoming readings against the stored condition.

## Geospatial Node

`GeospatialNode` collects geolocation history for subjects.

**Key methods**
- `Record` – store a latitude and longitude for a subject.
- `History` – retrieve recorded locations.

## Regulatory Node

`RegulatoryNode` cooperates with a `RegulatoryManager` to evaluate transactions and log flagged entities.

**Key methods**
- `ApproveTransaction` – check a transaction against regulations.
- `FlagEntity` and `Logs` – record and retrieve compliance events.

## Watchtower Node

`WatchtowerNode` monitors network health and detects forks.

**Key methods**
- `Start` / `Stop` – control monitoring routines.
- `ReportFork` – log fork events.
- `Metrics` – return collected system metrics.
- `Firewall` – access the embedded `Firewall` instance for rule management.

## Warfare Node

`WarfareNode` provides military-focused extensions such as secure command execution and logistics tracking.

**Key methods**
- `SecureCommand` – validate privileged commands.
- `TrackLogistics` and `Logistics` – record and query logistics events.
- `ShareTactical` – placeholder for distributing tactical information.

## Biometric Security Node

`BiometricSecurityNode` secures operations behind biometric authentication.

**Key methods**
- `Enroll` and `Remove` – manage biometric records.
- `Authenticate` – verify data for an address.
- `SecureExecute` – run a function only after successful biometric verification.

---

These building blocks can be combined to create rich node behaviour. Each node is a small, testable component that focuses on one responsibility, making the system easier to extend and maintain.

## opcode and gas guide

# Synnergy Opcode and Gas Guide

This guide describes how Synnergy assigns opcodes, prices execution and enforces gas usage.  It is derived from the canonical tables in `gas_table.go` and the dispatcher in `opcode_dispatcher.go`.

Stage 35 adds a wallet interface layer; while it introduces no new opcodes, the
CI and testing harness ensure existing gas costs remain stable when wallet
operations invoke the virtual machine.

Stage 13 extends the catalogue with opcodes for data distribution monitoring and
DEX liquidity queries so operational dashboards can estimate fees prior to
invocation.

Stage 28 validates that storage marketplace and analytics dashboard operations leverage this canonical gas schedule, ensuring user interfaces surface accurate fee estimates when invoking CLI commands.
Stage 43 adds pricing for DAO membership operations so governance tooling can anticipate the cost of adding or removing members via the `dao-members` CLI.

## Opcode Structure

Every exported function in the core packages is mapped to a unique 24‑bit opcode.  The format `0xCCNNNN` splits the value into a one‑byte **category** `CC` and a two‑byte **index** `NNNN`.  Categories correspond to major modules such as the ledger, AMM, state channels or the virtual machine.  The catalogue is generated automatically; the dispatcher resolves the opcode at runtime and invokes the appropriate handler.

## Operand Semantics

Opcodes follow a stack‑based calling convention:

* Operands are pushed on the VM stack in big‑endian word order.
* Handlers pop only the words they require.  Left‑over values remain on the stack for subsequent calls.
* Words are 32 bytes.  Smaller integers should be packed into a single word.  When strings or byte slices are used, the first word contains the length followed by contiguous data words.
* Address operands are 20 byte values right‑aligned within a 32 byte word.

Using the smallest possible data types, re‑using memory buffers and avoiding redundant stack reads lowers overall gas consumption.

### String and byte considerations

Strings are encoded as UTF‑8.  For fixed identifiers prefer `bytes32` to avoid dynamic‑length penalties.  Large blobs should be stored off‑chain and referred to by hash.

### Expansion techniques

Complex logic can be decomposed into multiple small opcodes or combined into a bulk operation that touches state once.  Expansion through macros or higher level language features (e.g. Solidity libraries, Rust traits, Yul functions, Go packages or JavaScript modules) keeps bytecode compact while enabling reuse.

## Gas Accounting and Fees

Gas prices are defined in [`gas_table.go`](gas_table.go).  Each opcode has a deterministic base cost reflecting CPU, storage and network impact.  From Stage 11 the table is populated at start-up by parsing [`gas_table_list.md`](../../gas_table_list.md), allowing operators to override prices without recompiling binaries.  Missing entries are charged `DefaultGasCost`.

Stage 19 introduces additional opcodes for the reserve‑backed `SYN1000` stablecoin and its index manager. Gas costs for creating tokens, adjusting reserves and computing valuations are explicitly defined to ensure predictable execution fees.
Stage 20 expands the opcode catalogue with dividend, convertible, governance,
capped supply, vesting, loyalty and multi‑chain token primitives. Each function
receives a deterministic gas price so these extensions remain affordable during
execution.

Stage 23 adds dedicated pricing for consensus mining and DAO governance
operations. CLI commands such as `consensus mine` and `dao create` now surface
their respective costs using the values from `gas_table_list.md`, allowing
operators to estimate fees before execution.
Stage 24 extends the table with cross-chain bridge deposits, protocol
registration and Plasma management. These opcodes allow the CLI to surface gas
usage for inter-chain transfers and bridge administration.

Stage 29 introduces deployable smart contract templates. Each template
(`token_faucet`, `storage_market`, `dao_governance`, `nft_minting`,
`ai_model_market`) receives a dedicated opcode and deterministic gas price so
operators can estimate costs before instantiation.
Stage 36 prices NFT marketplace operations so clients can predict the fees for
minting and trading non-fungible tokens through the CLI and GUI.

Stage 38 registers biometric security node enrollment and authentication
opcodes, ensuring CLI commands report deterministic gas costs for secure
transactions.
Stage 40 introduces opcodes for monetary policy queries (`BlockReward`, `CirculatingSupply`, `InitialPrice`, `MinimumStake`) so wallets can surface coin economics with accurate fee estimates, and expands the catalogue with compliance management and ledger compression handlers so KYC checks and snapshot operations carry predictable fees.

The VM charges gas **before** executing an opcode.  Dynamic portions – such as per‑word memory fees or refunds for resource release – are handled by the VM's gas meter.

```go
// gas_table.go
const DefaultGasCost uint64 = 1
```

### Fee calculation

`helpers.go` exposes the `DynamicGasCalculator` used by tooling and the CLI to estimate fees.  It walks a payload, decodes 3‑byte opcodes and sums their base cost.

```go
// helpers.go
func (d *DynamicGasCalculator) Estimate(payload []byte) (uint64, error) {
        ...
        total += GasCost(op)
        ...
}
```

`GasCost` performs a concurrent lookup in the in‑memory table and falls back to the default when an opcode is unknown. Stage 6 added structured logging so missing entries are reported for auditing.

```go
// gas_table.go
func GasCost(op Opcode) uint64 {
        if cost, ok := gasTable[op]; ok {
                return cost
        }
        log.Printf("gas_table: missing cost for opcode %d – charging default", op)
        return DefaultGasCost
}
```

`GasCostByName` lets applications fetch prices using a function's exported name
without manually converting it to an opcode.  This is useful for CLI and GUI
tooling that operates on high‑level function identifiers.

```go
// gas_table.go
cost := GasCostByName("Add")
```

Biometric authentication opcodes added in Stage 4 follow the same pricing
model and are listed in `gas_table_list.md` alongside other functions.

## Ledger synchronization and compression

Stage 5 introduces opcodes for `CompressLedger`, `DecompressLedger` and the
`SyncManager` (`Start`, `Stop`, `Status`, `Once`). Central bank and charity
modules (`Mint`, `UpdatePolicy`, `Register`, `Vote`) also receive dedicated
codes. Their base gas costs are defined in `gas_table_list.md` ensuring the VM
and CLI can accurately meter usage.

Stage 7 expands the catalogue with consensus management primitives. Validator registration, contract administration and the consensus service publish opcodes with explicit gas prices and emit OpenTelemetry traces for observability.

Stage 13 introduces zero trust data channel and regulatory node opcodes. These enable authenticated encrypted messaging and automatic compliance flagging. Base gas prices for these operations are listed in `gas_table_list.md` and surfaced through the dispatcher for both CLI and VM integrations.

Lowering fees is therefore a matter of choosing cheaper opcodes, batching writes and avoiding default‑priced unknown operations.

## Efficiency Patterns

* **Batch operations** – use bulk transfer, liquidity or governance methods to amortise fixed costs.
* **Read before write** – query state with cheap `Get*` calls before attempting expensive updates.
* **Free refunds** – deleting storage or self‑destructing contracts may refund part of the gas.
* **Externalise heavy data** – large strings or arrays should live in IPFS or another storage system and be referenced by hash.

## Language‑specific tips

### Solidity
Use libraries and events to keep runtime bytecode small.  Prefer `bytes32` for identifiers, pack structs and leverage `view` functions for off‑chain reads.

### Rust
When using `ink!` or other Rust‑based frameworks, mark functions as `#[payable]` only when necessary and reuse `Vec` allocations.  Traits allow opcode wrappers to be composed efficiently.

### Yul
Yul gives fine grained control over stack layout.  Preallocate memory and avoid leaving junk on the stack.  Macro‑based expansion can bundle repeated opcode sequences.

### JavaScript / TypeScript
Client side scripts typically interact with the VM via RPC.  Batch RPC calls and cache results.  When generating bytecode, reuse the dispatcher catalogue to look up opcodes instead of hard coding numbers.

### Go
Go contracts compiled to WASM should keep exported functions minimal and reuse byte slices.  Use the `DynamicGasCalculator` during development to estimate costs before deployment.

server. The orchestration layer does not alter opcode semantics or gas
pricing but ensures resources are isolated so gas accounting remains
predictable across replicas.

Stage 22 registers opcodes for querying node health so the Node Operations Dashboard can estimate gas costs before execution.

## script guide

# Synnergy Script Guide

This guide documents the utility scripts located in `cmd/scripts`. Each script wraps common `synnergy` CLI commands to showcase typical workflows and to help automate repetitive tasks during development. The collection now includes helpers for the faucet service, DAO voting, marketplace listings and storage deals. A working Go toolchain and the compiled `synnergy` binary are required.

## Prerequisites

1. Run `./setup_synn.sh` to install Go and fetch project dependencies.
2. Optionally execute `./Synnergy.env.sh` to configure additional environment variables and tools.
3. Build the CLI with `./build_cli.sh` or by invoking `go build -o synnergy ./cmd/synnergy` from the `synnergy-network` directory.

## Running the Demo Network

The `start_synnergy_network.sh` script launches a small local network and demonstrates basic commands:

```bash
./start_synnergy_network.sh
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. Compiles the CLI from `cmd/synnergy/main.go`.
2. Starts the networking, consensus, replication and VM services in the background.
3. Executes a sample `~sec merkle` command against demo data to show the security module.
4. Waits until you press `Ctrl+C`, then terminates all services.

Ensure the `synnergy` binary is present in the working directory and that `go` is on your `PATH` before running the demo.

## server setup guide

# Server Setup and Testing Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Synnergy blockchain on a fresh Linux server and run its full test suite. The steps use the repository root `/workspace/Synnergy.v.1` but can be adapted for any path.

## Prerequisites

Prepare a server with the following software:

- Linux distribution with `bash`
- Git
- Go 1.20 or newer
- Optional: Docker and Docker Compose for containerised runs

Update system packages and install prerequisites (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl build-essential docker.io docker-compose
```

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Synnergy.v.1.git
cd Synnergy.v.1
```

## Build the Command Line Interface

The repository includes helper scripts for installation and builds:

```bash
./setup_synn.sh        # install Go and compile the synnergy binary
# or for the full environment with optional tooling
./Synnergy.env.sh
```

To build manually:

```bash
cd synnergy-network
go mod tidy
GOFLAGS="-trimpath" go build -o synnergy ./cmd/synnergy
```

## Initialise a Local Node

```bash
cd synnergy-network
./synnergy ledger init --path ./ledger.db
./synnergy network start &
```

Open a new shell to interact with the node via the CLI. Useful scripts for multi-node setups are available in `scripts/` such as `devnet_start.sh` and `testnet_start.sh`.

## Run the Test Suite

Execute all Go tests to verify the environment:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Running tests may take several minutes and requires network access for some packages.

## Optional: Docker Deployment

A containerised node can be built with the included Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t synnergy .
docker run --rm -p 30303:30303 synnergy
```

For multi-service setups refer to `docker-compose.yml`.

## Next Steps

- Consult `README.md` for more development details

## smart contract guide

# Synnergy Smart Contract Guide

## Overview

Synnergy's contract platform executes WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode in a pluggable virtual machine. Contracts are registered through the on-chain `ContractRegistry` and executed deterministically with gas metering. This guide covers authoring, compiling, deploying and invoking contracts on a Synnergy node.

Contracts can be written in any language that compiles to WASM64. The repository includes Solidity examples compiled with a compatible toolchain. Rust and AssemblyScript are also common choices. Once compiled, bytecode is hashed to derive a deterministic contract address and may optionally include a Ricardian manifest binding legal terms to the code hash.

## Directory Structure

- `core/contracts.go` – runtime registry and deployment helpers.
- `core/virtual_machine.go` – virtual machine interfaces and in-memory state used during execution.
- `core/contracts_opcodes.go` – opcode constants reserved for contract operations.
- `cli/contracts.go` – CLI commands for compiling, deploying and invoking contracts.
- `cli/ai_contract.go` – Deploy and invoke AI-enhanced contracts with model tracking.
- `cli/audit.go` and `cli/audit_node.go` – Record and query audit logs from the CLI.
- `cmd/smart_contracts/` – example Solidity contracts demonstrating custom opcodes.

Review these files for implementation details and additional inline comments.

## Writing Contracts

1. **Choose a language** that targets WASM. Rust with `wasm-pack` or AssemblyScript are recommended for low level control.
2. **Follow the gas model** defined in `core/gas_table.go`. Each opcode consumes a fixed amount of gas. Custom opcodes such as `Liquidity_AddLiquidity` and `QueryOracle` are assigned specific costs.
3. **Interact with chain services** by calling exported opcodes via inline assembly. Examples in `cmd/smart_contracts` show how to mint tokens, add liquidity or query an oracle using assembly `call` instructions.
4. **Keep code deterministic** – avoid sources of randomness or floating point arithmetic that could diverge across nodes.

### Ricardian Manifest

A Ricardian contract is a JSON file that links legal prose to a specific code hash. When deploying a contract you may supply a manifest containing fields such as:

```json
{
  "name": "TokenMinter",
  "version": "1.0",
  "author": "Example Corp",
  "terms": "<link to PDF or legal text>",
  "hash": "<sha256 of wasm bytecode>"
}
```

The CLI stores this manifest on the ledger so anyone can audit the deployed code and its associated terms.

## Compiling

Use the `contracts compile` command to convert a WAT or WASM file into a deterministic byte blob. The command invokes `wat2wasm` if a `.wat` source is provided. Output is written to the directory specified by `WASM_OUT_DIR` (defaults to `./wasm`). Example:

```bash
synnergy contracts compile ./examples/hello.wat
```

This prints the output path and hash of the compiled artifact. The hash is later used to derive the contract address.

## Deployment

Deploy a compiled WASM binary with optional Ricardian manifest:

```bash
synnergy contracts deploy --wasm ./wasm/hello.wasm --ric ./manifest.json --gas 3000000
```

Deployment registers the contract in the `ContractRegistry`, persists bytecode to the ledger and sets the maximum gas limit. The resulting address is printed to stdout.

## Invocation

Invoke methods using the `contracts invoke` subcommand. Arguments are passed as hex bytes and a gas limit must be specified:

```bash
synnergy contracts invoke 0xabc... --method greet --args 48656c6c6f --gas 200000
```

The registry locates the contract, executes it inside the VM and returns any bytes produced by the call. Use `contracts list` to see all deployed addresses or `contracts info <addr>` to display stored Ricardian metadata.

## Example Contracts

Several Solidity examples live under `cmd/smart_contracts`:

- **cross_chain_eth.sol** – simple Ether bridge emitting events for off‑chain relayers.
- **liquidity_adder.sol** – demonstrates calling the custom `Liquidity_AddLiquidity` opcode.
- **multi_sig_wallet.sol** – basic multisig wallet requiring multiple confirmations.
- **oracle_reader.sol** – queries a Synnergy oracle via opcode `QueryOracle`.
- **token_minter.sol** – mints tokens using the `MintToken` opcode.

These files showcase how inline assembly can access Synnergy-specific opcodes that extend beyond standard Ethereum functionality.

## Testing

Unit tests for the contract system reside in `tests/contracts_test.go`. They illustrate basic deployment and invocation flows using the in-memory ledger provided by `core`. Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./tests -run Contracts
```

Ensure all tests pass before deploying contracts on a live network.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control** – commit both source and compiled WASM to guarantee reproducible builds.
- **Gas Limits** – estimate execution cost and set generous gas limits when deploying. Excess gas is refunded.
- **Security Reviews** – audit contracts thoroughly; once deployed code cannot be replaced except through a migration process.
- **Logging** – use the logging facilities in `core` to emit structured logs from your contract for easier debugging.
- **Static Calls** – where possible, read contract state with `StaticCall` to avoid unintended mutations.

## Further Reading

- [`cli_guide.md`](cli_guide.md) – overview of all CLI command groups.
- [`module_guide.md`](module_guide.md) – descriptions of core modules including the VM and ledger.
- [`config_guide.md`](config_guide.md) – details on configuring a Synnergy node.
- `tests/` – unit tests demonstrating module usage.

With these resources you can author robust smart contracts on Synnergy, deploy them to the ledger and interact with them via the provided CLI.

## synnergy network function web

# Synnergy Network Function Web

This document provides a high-level function web for the Synnergy network, outlining major modules and their core functions. Stage 4 debuts the Authority Node Index, supplying both CLI and GUI layers with a configurable registry of authority nodes. Stage 7 adds a cross-chain bridge monitor GUI exposing transfer status through CLI hooks. Stage 8 expands cross-chain registries and bridge managers with CLI access and gas‑priced opcodes. Stage 9 adds governance primitives, custodial nodes and cross-consensus network management. Stage 12 introduces a data distribution monitor with CLI and GUI telemetry for network flows. Stage 13 layers in a DEX screener for liquidity insights. Stage 14 introduces a unified `internal/nodes` package with light, watchtower and logistics implementations. Stage 15 extends this package with forensic, geospatial, historical and holographic nodes for richer diagnostics and data distribution. It also introduces an Explorer GUI exposing these diagnostics through a CLI-backed interface.
Stage 17 standardises token contracts for CBDCs, pausable utility assets and
gaming items, all backed by the thread-safe base token and accessible through
the CLI. Stage 18 adds investor share registries, insurance policies, forex
pairs, fiat-pegged currencies, index funds, charity campaigns and legal document
tokens with validation and CLI-driven deactivation.
Stage 19 introduces the SYN1000 reserve-backed stablecoin and index manager with precise gas-priced opcodes and CLI integration.
Stage 20 adds dividend, convertible, governance, capped supply, vesting,
loyalty and multi-chain token modules, all wired into the function web and
available through the CLI and VM. Stage 22 unifies AI contract and audit log
commands with JSON output so dashboards and automated agents can interact with
the network through a consistent CLI surface.
Stage 23 brings gas-aware consensus and DAO governance commands into the
function web, enabling user interfaces to display the cost of mining blocks or
managing proposals directly alongside execution results.
Stage 24 extends cross-chain and Plasma management. The CLI now exposes bridge
registration, connection tracking and gas-priced transfer operations that UIs
can invoke for inter-network workflows.
Stage 42 builds on this by adding the `cross_tx` module so the function web can
initiate lock‑mint and burn‑release flows with JSON responses and audited gas
charges. Bridge, protocol, connection, contract mapping and custodial node
CLIs now emit structured JSON, letting web interfaces coordinate cross-chain
transfers end‑to‑end.
Stage 35 delivers a production-ready wallet interface with rigorous testing and
CI integration, allowing web dashboards to securely sign and submit
transactions through the same function web.
Stage 25 finalises node operations. Full, light, mining, mobile, optimisation,
staking, watchtower and warfare nodes offer JSON emitting commands allowing the
function web and external dashboards to orchestrate infrastructure with defined
gas costs. A security operations center and smart contract marketplace expose
these capabilities through hardened GUIs backed by CLI hooks.
Stage 26 extends operational visibility with gas table controls. Operators can
adjust opcode pricing on the fly and export the entire schedule as JSON,
enabling governance portals and monitoring systems to consume pricing data
directly from the CLI.
Stage 27 layers in automation scripts for devnets and testnets, contract deployment helpers and quality gates, letting dashboards orchestrate network lifecycles through the CLI.
Stage 28 adds release packaging, documentation generation, CI preparation and ledger backup tooling so user interfaces like the storage marketplace and system analytics dashboard can trigger builds, publish docs and safeguard chain data via the function web.

Stage 29 introduces smart contract templates accessible through the CLI. Dashboards
can list and deploy precompiled modules such as token faucets, storage markets,
DAO governance systems, NFT minters and AI model exchanges directly from the
function web.
Stage 30 expands this catalog with utility contracts for escrow payments,
cross‑chain bridges, multisig wallets and regulatory compliance workflows,
ensuring dashboards and CLI users can assemble more complex decentralized
applications from vetted building blocks.
Stage 31 debuts a CLI‑driven GUI wallet that signs transactions locally and
interacts with the function web via JSON responses, proving out end‑user
workflows without trusting the browser with private keys.
Stage 34 also delivers a wallet administration interface exposing signature
verification and policy controls through the function web. In addition, Stage 34
layers on a smart‑contract marketplace GUI that invokes new
`marketplace` CLI commands to deploy WebAssembly modules and transfer contract
ownership, expanding the function web to cover contract trading flows.
Stage 35 introduces a storage marketplace GUI backed by `storage_marketplace`
CLI operations and storage-specific opcodes so dashboards can list offerings
and open deals through the same function web.
Stage 36 adds an NFT marketplace GUI driven by the `nft` CLI module so
applications can mint and trade unique assets within the function web.
Stage 38 introduces a token creation tool GUI that generates token contracts through the CLI and finalises biometric security node commands, enabling dashboards to craft new assets and enforce biometric verification within the function web.
Stage 39 adds a DEX Screener GUI that leverages `liquidity_views` commands so interfaces can stream pool reserves and fees.
Stage 40 introduces administrative dashboards for authority node indexing and cross-chain management, exposing node and bridge status through CLI-driven views. The central bank module joins the function web at this stage, allowing monetary policy updates and CBDC issuance to be orchestrated alongside other network services via `synnergy centralbank`. Biometric security node and compliance management commands now emit JSON, letting interfaces verify identity templates and policy status before invoking token or network operations.
Coin supply metrics are also exposed through `synnergy coin`, which validates inputs and emits JSON so wallets and dashboards can retrieve rewards and circulating supply.
Stage 41 refines consensus tooling with a connection pool release command, gas-aware contract opcode listings, and validated consensus management commands, allowing dashboards to manage peers and cost insights across the function web.
Stage 43 extends governance support by introducing DAO management commands that emit JSON and utilise ECDSA verification, enabling interfaces to create organisations, enrol members and list active DAOs securely through the function web.
Stage 44 adds a smart contract test harness exercising the token faucet template through the CLI, ensuring contract modules function reliably across the function web.
Stage 46 introduces an automated network harness that assembles wallet services
and in-memory nodes to verify end-to-end transaction propagation and gas
accounting from the CLI through the consensus layer.

Stage 22 adds the Node Operations Dashboard, giving operators a dedicated CLI and web interface for real-time node monitoring.

## synnergy set up

# Synnergy CLI Enterprise Setup Guide

This guide explains how to prepare a development or testing environment for the
`synnergy` command line interface (CLI) and associated services.  It covers
system requirements, building from source, configuration management and
starting a small multi-service network suitable for enterprise evaluation.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before compiling the CLI ensure the following software is installed:

- **Go 1.20 or newer** – verify with `go version`
- **Git** – for fetching the repository
- **GNU build tools** – `gcc`, `make`, and related packages
- **Docker** *(optional)* – used to run supporting services such as
  databases or reverse proxies

The provided `Synnergy.env.sh` script installs Go and common utilities on
Debian based systems.  Execute the script as root or with `sudo` if you do not
already have a Go toolchain installed.

```bash
./Synnergy.env.sh
```

## 2. Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd synnergy-network
```

All commands below assume the working directory is `synnergy-network`.

## 3. Building the CLI

1. Download Go module dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
2. Compile the main program:
   ```bash
   go build -o synnergy ./cmd/synnergy
   ```
   The resulting executable `synnergy` is placed in the current directory.
   Optionally move it somewhere in your `PATH` for easier access.

You can also build the CLI using the helper script found in
`cmd/scripts/build_cli.sh` which performs the same steps.

## 4. Configuration Files

Runtime settings are defined in the `cmd/config` directory.  The CLI loads
`default.yaml` by default and merges any environment specific file when the
`SYNN_ENV` variable is set.  For example, `SYNN_ENV=prod` loads `prod.yaml` in
addition to `default.yaml`.

Configuration options include network parameters, consensus settings, virtual
machine limits and logging preferences.  See `docs/guides/config_guide.md` for a
full description of each field.

## 5. Environment Variables

Several commands rely on environment variables in addition to the YAML
configuration files.  The most common variables are:

- `LEDGER_PATH` – path to the ledger database
- `P2P_LISTEN_ADDR` – multiaddr for the libp2p node
- `P2P_BOOTSTRAP` – comma-separated list of bootstrap peers
- `KEYSTORE_PATH` – directory containing node and validator keys
- `SECURITY_API_ADDR` – address of the security daemon
- `SYN_DEBUG_OPCODES` – if set, enable verbose opcode logging on startup

Create a `.env` file with these values or export them in your shell before
running commands.  The `Synnergy.env.sh` script automatically loads a
`synnergy-network/.env` file if present.

## 6. Starting a Local Network

The simplest way to launch all core services is via the example script
`cmd/scripts/start_synnergy_network.sh`.  It compiles the CLI and starts the
network, consensus, replication and virtual machine daemons.

```bash
cd cmd/scripts
./start_synnergy_network.sh
```

To start components manually:

1. **Initialise the ledger**
   ```bash
   ./synnergy ledger init --path ./ledger.db
   ```
2. **Start networking and consensus services**
   ```bash
   ./synnergy network start
   ./synnergy consensus start
   ```
3. **Create a wallet and fund it**
   ```bash
   ./synnergy wallet create --out wallet.json
   ./synnergy coin mint $(jq -r .address wallet.json) 1000
   ```

At this point you may explore command groups such as `contracts` for deploying
WebAssembly code, `tokens` for managing ERC‑20 style assets or `transactions`
for building and broadcasting raw transactions.  See `docs/guides/cli_guide.md` for
a description of every available command.

## 7. Running Unit Tests

The repository includes a suite of unit tests under `tests/`.  Execute them with

```bash
go test ./...
```

Some tests require auxiliary services or specific environment variables.  Review
the comments in each test file for details.

## 8. Production Considerations

For larger deployments consider the following practices:

- Use `bootstrap.yaml` as a template for dedicated bootstrap nodes
- Configure persistent storage volumes for the ledger and keystore directories
- Run security-related services on isolated hosts with restricted firewall rules
- Enable detailed logging and centralise logs using your preferred observability
  stack
- Maintain separate configuration files for development, staging and production
  environments to avoid accidental cross-contamination

## 9. Additional Resources

- **Command Reference:** `docs/guides/cli_guide.md`
- **Scripting Examples:** `docs/guides/script_guide.md`
- **Core Modules Overview:** `docs/guides/module_guide.md`
- **Whitepaper:** `WHITEPAPER.md`

These documents provide further background on the Synnergy architecture and the
individual command groups available within the CLI.

---

Once the CLI is built and the network services are running you are ready to
experiment with the modular blockchain components that make up Synnergy.

## token guide

# Token Guide

This guide explains how tokens are organised and implemented in the Synnergy Network.
It summarises the core token abstractions, the registry used to manage them and the
built-in token standards provided by the project.

Stage 28 introduces release packaging and documentation tooling for token modules so audited contracts can be published and consumed by dashboards through the CLI.

Stage 12 adds a data distribution monitor exposing CLI and GUI metrics for token flows across the network.
Stage 13 expands monitoring with a DEX screener interface, allowing token
holders to inspect liquidity pools and pricing directly through the CLI and
web dashboards.

Stage 6 integrates compliance checks into token operations via the new logging subsystem, allowing auditors to trace token transactions.

Stage 7 adds coded error handling and telemetry spans to token registry and CLI interactions, enabling operators to correlate failures across services.
Stage 8 introduces cross‑chain token bridging via the `CrossChainTxManager`, allowing assets to move between ledgers through gas‑priced CLI calls.
Stage 42 enhances these flows with a dedicated `cross_tx` command offering
lock‑mint and burn‑release operations that emit JSON, simplifying integration
with wallets and dashboards.
Stage 9 adds a dedicated DAO token ledger with staking support and burn capabilities for governance assets.
Stage 25 extends staking usability via the `staking_node` CLI module which
emits JSON responses for stake, unstake and balance queries, enabling wallets to
integrate staking flows directly.
Stage 31 introduces a GUI wallet that consumes these JSON interfaces and
invokes token operations through the CLI, providing an accessible reference
implementation for external applications.
Stage 35 adds production-ready wallet tooling with CI, configuration and
automated tests so token workflows remain secure across both CLI and GUI
interfaces.
Stage 34 extends the ecosystem with a smart‑contract marketplace GUI allowing
tokenised contracts to be deployed and traded through the same CLI surface,
demonstrating how assets can change ownership without leaving the network.
Stage 35 introduces a storage marketplace where capacity is tokenised and traded
through CLI and GUI components, enabling decentralised data leasing.
Stage 36 debuts an NFT marketplace module allowing unique assets to be minted
and exchanged through unified CLI and GUI workflows with deterministic gas
costs.
Stage 38 adds a token creation tool GUI that spawns the CLI to instantiate new token contracts, simplifying asset deployment within the network.
Biometric-secured token operations ensure that only enrolled addresses can
execute sensitive transfers through the CLI.
Stage 39 integrates a DEX Screener GUI that reports pool reserves for token pairs via CLI, helping traders evaluate liquidity before interacting with token contracts.
Stage 40 strengthens monetary management by exposing the `coin` CLI with JSON output and validated parameters so wallets can query supply, rewards and staking thresholds securely. It also finalises biometric security node and compliance management commands with structured JSON, enabling wallets and dashboards to validate identity and policy status before executing token transfers.
Stage 41 enhances consensus and contract management CLI modules with strict input validation, improving reliability for token operations invoked through the CLI.
Stage 11 ensures token operations execute inside managed VM sandboxes with explicit cleanup semantics and idle sandboxes are automatically purged once their TTL expires.
Stage 13 links token flows with regulatory nodes, allowing non-compliant transfers to be flagged in real time for audit trails.
Stage 16 makes the base token and registry concurrency‑safe and includes micro‑benchmarks to monitor transfer throughput.
Stage 17 introduces a suite of standard token contracts such as CBDCs, pausable
utility tokens and in‑game asset registries. These implementations embed the
thread‑safe base token and expose dedicated CLI commands for minting and
transfer operations.

Stage 18 extends the library with investor share tokens, multiple insurance
registries, forex pairs, fiat‑pegged currencies, index funds, charity campaigns
and legal document tokens. Each contract validates inputs and allows
administrators to deactivate assets through the CLI.

Stage 23 integrates DAO token ledger operations with gas-aware CLI commands,
allowing governance tokens to report the cost of minting, transferring and
burning directly to operators.
Stage 24 exposes cross-chain bridge and Plasma controls with deterministic gas
charges so token transfers across networks remain predictable.

Stage 29 provides ready-made contract templates including token faucets and DAO
governance modules. These templates simplify token bootstrapping and are
accessible via `synnergy contracts deploy-template`.

## Package layout

Token code lives under `internal/tokens`.  Key files are:

- `base.go` – defines the `Token` interface and a reusable `BaseToken` implementation.
- `index.go` – provides a registry to create, lookup and list token instances.
- Additional files such as `syn10.go` or `syn4200_token.go` implement individual
  token standards.

The command line wrappers under `cli/` expose similar functionality for interacting
with tokens via CLI commands. For sensitive assets these commands can be wrapped
by the `BiometricSecurityNode`, requiring signed biometric proofs before
transfers or mint operations are accepted.

## Base token

Every token implements the `Token` interface which exposes common behaviour:
`ID`, `Name`, `Symbol`, `Decimals`, `TotalSupply`, `BalanceOf`, `Transfer`,
`TransferFrom`, `Mint`, `Burn`, `Approve` and `Allowance`.
The `BaseToken` struct in `base.go` provides a straightforward implementation of
this interface and handles supply accounting and allowance management.

To define a new fungible token, compose your struct with `*BaseToken` and add any
custom state or methods required by the standard.

## Token registry

The registry in `index.go` assigns unique identifiers and keeps a map of active
tokens.  It can return metadata for a single token or list all registered tokens.
Projects typically create a registry at start up and register each token as it is
initialised.

```go
reg := tokens.NewRegistry()
id  := reg.NextID()
my  := tokens.NewSYN20Token(id, "My Token", "MYT", 18)
reg.Register(my)
```

## Built-in token standards

The repository includes several reference token implementations that demonstrate
how specialised assets can be modelled on top of the base abstractions:

| Token file | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `syn10.go` | Central bank digital currency with issuer and exchange-rate controls. |
| `syn12.go` | Tokenised treasury bill instrument including maturity and discount fields. |
| `syn20.go` | Fungible token with pause and address freeze capabilities. |
| `syn70.go` | Registry for in‑game assets, supporting attributes and achievements. |
| `syn200.go` | Carbon credit projects with issuance, retirement and verification tracking. |
| `syn223_token.go` | Secure transfer token that enforces whitelist and blacklist rules. |
| `syn300_token.go` | Governance token supporting delegation and on‑chain proposals. |
| `syn845.go` | Debt token registry for recording loans and repayments. |
| `syn1000.go` & `syn1000_index.go` | Thread‑safe reserve‑backed stablecoin with high‑precision accounting and an index for managing multiple instances. |
| `syn1100.go` | Healthcare record storage with access control lists. |
| `storage_market.rs` | Decentralised storage marketplace contract template. |
| `syn2369.go` | Virtual item registry for metaverse assets. |
| `syn2500_token.go` | DAO membership registry with voting power metadata. |
| `syn2600.go` | Investor tokens that record share ownership and return distributions. |
| `syn2800.go` | Life‑insurance policies with premium and claim management. |
| `syn2900.go` | General insurance policies and claim handling. |
| `syn3400.go` | Foreign‑exchange pair registry with rate updates. |
| `syn3500_token.go` | Fiat‑pegged currency token with mint and redeem operations. |
| `syn3700_token.go` | Index token that aggregates multiple assets by weight. |
| `syn4200_token.go` | Charity campaign token used for tracking donations. |
| `syn2700.go` | Dividend token distributing rewards proportionally to holders. |
| `syn3200.go` | Convertible token applying a dynamic conversion ratio. |
| `syn3600.go` | Governance weight ledger for on‑chain voting schemes. |
| `syn3800.go` | Capped supply token enforcing hard issuance limits. |
| `syn3900.go` | Vesting token releasing grants after a specified time. |
| `syn500.go` | Loyalty points token with expirations. |
| `syn5000.go` | Multi‑chain token supporting cross‑chain transfers. |
| `syn4700.go` | Legal document token recording parties, signatures and dispute status. |

These examples can be used as templates when designing new token types.

## Native coin

The native asset **Synthron** is defined in `core/coin.go`. It exposes helper
functions for block rewards, supply tracking and staking economics. The `coin`
CLI command surfaces these utilities and provides JSON output for web
dashboards. Minting beyond the capped supply is prevented by the
`CentralBankingNode` which enforces checks against `RemainingSupply`.

## AI model access tokens

Stage 2 introduces AI-enhanced contracts and audit modules. Projects can mint
tokens that meter access to deployed models or audit logs, leveraging the
standard registry and `BaseToken` abstractions.

## Institutional and governance tokens

Stage 3 adds authority and banking node modules. Tokens representing voting
power or institutional membership can be combined with the `AuthorityNodeRegistry`
and `BankInstitutionalNode` to restrict transfers or confer special privileges.
The CLI outputs JSON, allowing web interfaces to track tokenised governance
rights alongside registered financial institutions.

## Creating a new token

1. Decide whether the token is fungible.  For fungible tokens embed `*BaseToken`.
2. Obtain a unique ID from the registry and instantiate your token.
3. Register the token so that it can be retrieved by ID or symbol.
4. Extend with any domain‑specific methods or data structures.

Stage 44 introduces contract-level tests for the token faucet template deployed via the CLI and VM, providing a blueprint for verifying future token modules.

## Kubernetes deployment
Tokens interact with network services regardless of the execution
environment. When running nodes on Kubernetes using the manifests in
`deploy/k8s/`, token transactions and registry operations are available
through the wallet server and CLI just as in bare‑metal setups.

## Testing

Unit tests for the token package can be executed with:

```bash
go test ./internal/tokens
```

Running the full repository test suite will also exercise all token
implementations.

Stage 22 introduces node-operations tokens that power the Node Operations Dashboard and enable operators to stake and monitor infrastructure activity.

## transaction guide

4.4.8. Transaction
Transactions are the core of any blockchain system, representing the exchange of value, data, or assets among participants. The Synnergy Network, with its Synthron coin, prioritizes security, efficiency, and scalability in transaction management. This section delves into the intricate details of transaction processing, fee structures, and the innovative features that set the Synnergy Network apart from other blockchain platforms.
Transaction Management System
The transaction management system in the Synnergy Network is designed to handle a high volume of transactions securely and efficiently. 

4.4.8.1. Transaction Fees
Transaction fees are critical in maintaining the network’s security, incentivizing participants, and ensuring sustainable operations. The Synnergy Network employs a dynamic and transparent fee structure that adapts to network conditions and user demands.

4.4.8.1.1. Fee Sharing Model
The Synnergy Network employs a sophisticated fee-sharing model to ensure fair and incentivized participation by validators and miners.
Proportional Distribution:
Validators and miners share in the transaction fees based on their active participation in the block production process. This model ensures they are economically incentivized to include transactions in their blocks, aligning their interests with the overall transaction throughput of the network.
Detailed Breakdown of the Fee Sharing Model:
Calculation of Fee Shares: Validators and miners receive a proportional share of the total transaction fees collected in each block. The share each participant receives is calculated based on the number of transactions they processed relative to the total number of transactions in the block.
Example:
If a block contains 100 transactions and a validator processes 20 of them, the validator will receive 20% of the total transaction fees for that block.
Real-Time Processing: The distribution of fees is handled in real-time, ensuring that validators and miners receive their shares immediately upon block finalization. This enhances transparency and trust in the reward system.
Economic Impact:
Encouraging Full Blocks: By tying economic incentives directly to transaction processing, validators and miners are motivated to include as many transactions as possible in each block, maximizing their potential earnings from fees and improving network throughput.
Adaptation to Network Conditions: The fee-sharing model can adapt to changing network conditions, such as fluctuations in transaction volume or fee levels, ensuring that validators and miners' efforts are consistently and fairly rewarded.


4.4.8.1.2. Calculation of Fee Shares:
The calculation of fee shares is a critical component of the Synnergy Network's fee distribution model. It ensures that validators and miners who contribute more to the network by processing a higher number of transactions receive a proportionally higher share of the transaction fees. This incentivizes active participation and maintains the network's efficiency and security.
Proportional Distribution Model
Overview:
The proportional distribution model is designed to reward validators and miners based on their level of activity and contribution to the network. This method ensures fairness and aligns the interests of validators and miners with the overall performance and throughput of the blockchain.
Key Elements:
Total Block Fees:
This represents the sum of all transaction fees collected in a given block. Transaction fees are paid by users for the processing and confirmation of their transactions on the blockchain.
Transactions Processed by Validator/Miners:
This is the number of transactions a specific validator or miner has processed within a particular block. It reflects the validator's or miner's contribution to the block's transaction processing.
Total Transactions in Block:
This is the total number of transactions included in a specific block. It serves as a benchmark for calculating the proportional contribution of each validator or miner.
Calculation Formula:
The fee share for each validator or miner is calculated using the formula:
Validator/Miner Fee = Total Block Fees x (Transactions Validated by validator or miner / total transactions in block)
This formula ensures that the fee distribution is directly proportional to the number of transactions processed by each validator or miner. Validators and miners who process more transactions receive a larger share of the total fees.
Implementation Details:
Real-Time Tracking:
The system continuously monitors the number of transactions processed by each validator or miner in real-time. This data is crucial for the accurate calculation of fee shares.
Automated Distribution:
Upon block finalization, the system automatically calculates and distributes the fees to validators and miners. This automation reduces the potential for errors and ensures timely payments.
Transparency and Accountability:
Detailed records of fee calculations and distributions are maintained. This transparency allows validators, miners, and other stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the fee sharing process.
Economic Incentives
Encouraging Active Participation:
By rewarding validators and miners based on the number of transactions they process, the system encourages active participation. Validators and miners are motivated to process as many transactions as possible to maximize their earnings.
Ensuring Network Efficiency:
The proportional distribution model incentivizes validators and miners to prioritize transaction processing, which enhances the overall efficiency and throughput of the network. This, in turn, benefits users by reducing transaction confirmation times and lowering latency.
Fair Compensation:
The fee-sharing mechanism ensures that validators and miners are fairly compensated for their efforts. Those who contribute more to the network's operations receive higher rewards, aligning financial incentives with the network's health and performance.
Real-World Implementation
Scalability:
The proportional distribution model is scalable and can handle varying levels of network activity. As the network grows and the number of transactions increases, the model can adapt to ensure fair and efficient fee distribution.
Security Measures:
To prevent fraudulent activities, such as validators or miners attempting to manipulate transaction counts, the system includes robust security measures. These may include regular audits, anomaly detection, and slashing mechanisms for dishonest behavior.
Regulatory Compliance:
The fee-sharing model is designed to comply with relevant financial regulations. This includes transparent reporting, adherence to tax laws, and mechanisms for addressing disputes.
User Experience:
Users benefit from a responsive and efficient network. By ensuring that validators and miners are adequately incentivized, the network maintains high performance and reliability, leading to a positive user experience.




4.4.8.1.3. Technical Details of Fee Distribution
The distribution of fees in the Synnergy Network is managed through smart contracts. These contracts are automated programs that run on the blockchain, executing predefined instructions when certain conditions are met. Utilizing smart contracts for fee distribution ensures that the process is transparent, reliable, and free from human error.
Benefits of Smart Contract Implementation:
Automation:
Smart contracts automate the entire fee distribution process, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This reduces the risk of errors and disputes, ensuring that validators and miners receive their rightful shares promptly.
