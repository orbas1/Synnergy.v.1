# Synnergy Network Final Upgrade Plan

## Purpose
This document consolidates the latest production-readiness assessment for the Synnergy Network and translates the identified gaps into a set of prioritized upgrade workstreams. It is intended to guide engineering, security, compliance, and operations teams through the final hardening cycle required to meet S-tier launch expectations.

## S-Tier Production Readiness Scale
The Synnergy program evaluates every functional category on a 0–100 readiness scale. Scores are mapped to tiers in order to align remediation urgency with launch risk.

| Score | Tier |
| ----- | ---- |
| 90–100 | S |
| 80–89 | A |
| 70–79 | B |
| 60–69 | C |
| 50–59 | D |
| 40–49 | E |
| 30–39 | F |
| 20–29 | G |
| 10–19 | H |
| 0–9 | I |

## Overall Status
- **Current score:** **28 / 100**  
- **Tier:** **G**  
- **Summary:** Security, consensus integrity, custody, and data governance gaps create existential risk for mainnet release. Reliability, observability, compliance, and developer ecosystem maturity further lag, indicating the platform is still at a pilot-readiness stage.

## Gap Inventory for Final Upgrades
### 1. Security & Cryptography
- Resolve all 170 gosec findings (integer overflows, unchecked errors, weak RNG usage).  
- Move validator keys from global memory maps to hardware-backed custody (HSM/KMS) with rotation.  
- Handle signing errors explicitly and add double-signing detection plus slashing.  
- Replace non-deterministic `math/rand` calls with audited `crypto/rand` primitives.  
- Integrate centralized secrets management (Vault/KMS) with rotation and sealed storage.  
- Enforce mutual TLS, adaptive rate limiting, and signed requests at all perimeters.

### 2. Core Protocol Integrity
- Ship formal safety proofs, hysteresis, and coordination for consensus hopping.  
- Define fork-choice/finality guards and slashing logic for equivocation.  
- Harden the WAL with fsync, checksums, and invariant enforcement.  
- Verify signatures during state sync; reconcile divergent histories prior to replay.  
- Automate staking lifecycle (bonding, unbonding, slashing, tombstoning) tied to evidence storage.

### 3. Cross-Chain & Asset Custody
- Require proof verification, signature checks, and Merkle root validation before fund release.  
- Domain-separate transfer identifiers and prevent replay through nonce tracking.

- Launch formal validator/regulator/auditor training backed by maintained runbooks.

## Final Upgrade Workstreams
### 1. Security & Custody Strike Team (Weeks 0–4)

### 2. Protocol Correctness Wave (Weeks 4–8)
Deliver consensus hysteresis and safety proofs, harden the WAL with fsync and checksums, and enforce slashing/unbonding anchored to append-only evidence stores.

### 3. Data Governance & Compliance Hardening (Weeks 6–10)
Encrypt and govern identity/compliance data, anchor audit artifacts immutably, integrate sanctions/AML feeds, and generate exportable compliance evidence packages.

### 4. Reliability & Observability Sprint (Weeks 8–12)
Ship quorum-aware failover, chaos/disaster recovery automation, full telemetry pipelines, and production-scale capacity benchmarks including gas validation.

### 5. Ecosystem & Documentation Enablement (Weeks 10–14)
Publish a unified go-live checklist and ADR library, release stable APIs/SDKs plus partner guides, and establish recurring security/compliance reporting cadences.

## Success Metrics
- **Security:** Zero critical gosec findings; all keys under hardware-backed custody with rotation SLAs.  
- **Protocol Integrity:** Consensus failover drills produce no forks; slashing/tombstoning events automatically recorded.  
- **Custody:** All cross-chain transfers accompanied by verified proofs and tamper-evident custody records.  
- **Compliance:** Sanctions screening enforced across all inflows/outflows with exportable evidence.  
- **Reliability:** Disaster recovery restores complete state within RPO/RTO targets; telemetry coverage >95% of critical components.  
- **Documentation:** Up-to-date production readiness guide, ADRs, and partner integration playbooks published.

## Next Steps
1. Assign accountable owners for each workstream and publish sprint backlogs.  
2. Stand up cross-functional program reviews every two weeks to validate progress against success metrics.  
3. Update this document upon completion of each milestone or discovery of new production blockers.
