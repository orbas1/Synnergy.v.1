# Synnergy Network Final Upgrade Plan

## Purpose
This document consolidates the latest production-readiness assessment for the Synnergy Network and translates the identified gaps into a set of prioritized upgrade workstreams. It is intended to guide engineering, security, compliance, and operations teams through the final hardening cycle required to meet S-tier launch expectations.

## S-Tier Production Readiness Scale
The Synnergy program evaluates every functional category on a 0–100 readiness scale. Scores are mapped to tiers in order to align remediation urgency with launch risk.

| Score | Tier |
| ----- | ---- |
| 90–100 | S |
| 80–89 | A |
| 70–79 | B |
| 60–69 | C |
| 50–59 | D |
| 40–49 | E |
| 30–39 | F |
| 20–29 | G |
| 10–19 | H |
| 0–9 | I |

## Overall Status
- **Current score:** **28 / 100**  
- **Tier:** **G**  
- **Summary:** Security, consensus integrity, custody, and data governance gaps create existential risk for mainnet release. Reliability, observability, compliance, and developer ecosystem maturity further lag, indicating the platform is still at a pilot-readiness stage.

### Tokens & Asset Lifecycle (Score 42 / Tier E)
- **State of Play:** Token registries (SYN20, SYN30, SYN900) depend on off-chain oracle inputs and manual custody attestations, producing reconciliation gaps for wrapped and synthetic assets. Distribution logs are mutable and rely on unsupervised operators, creating counterparty risk during mint/burn cycles.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Introduce MPC/HSM-backed custody workflows for mint/burn keys with real-time rotation SLAs.
  - Enforce multi-oracle quorum attestations (2-of-3 minimum) with signed transcripts anchored on-chain.
  - Automate daily reconciliation between treasury wallets, circulating supply, and oracle feeds with alerting on variance.
- **Validation Signals:** Completion of red-team custody drills, zero manual override events in audit logs, and live dashboards showing oracle quorum health and supply reconciliation.

### Storage & Evidence Management (Score 35 / Tier F)
- **State of Play:** Critical artifacts (consensus logs, regulatory approvals, zero-knowledge proofs) reside in mutable object storage without retention locks, immutability, or automated evidence promotion. Archival nodes advertise availability but lack cryptographic proof of data completeness.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Roll out tamper-evident WORM storage for audit logs, consensus evidence, and compliance artifacts with retention automation.
  - Implement periodic cryptographic sealing (Merkle sealing + notary timestamping) for archival snapshots consumed by regulators.
  - Deliver storage attestation services that prove block/transaction completeness and enable rapid disaster recovery restores.
- **Validation Signals:** Successful restore drills from sealed archives, immutable log attestations passing third-party audit, and green status on storage attestation dashboards across all regions.

### Governance & Treasury Oversight (Score 33 / Tier F)
- **State of Play:** DAO governance (SYN300) permits proposals and voting but lacks enforced quorum, time-lock execution, and tamper-evident treasury event trails. Treasury multi-sig keys are untracked, and there is no regulator-facing ledger for high-value disbursements.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Implement executable governance pipelines with quorum enforcement, challenge windows, and programmatic execution guards.
  - Enforce dual-control/segregation-of-duties on treasury operations with MPC-signed disbursements and full auditability.
  - Publish regulator-grade reporting (balance sheets, vote outcomes, treasury deltas) with automated delivery and legal-hold support.
- **Validation Signals:** On-chain governance events mapped to executed code changes, successful completion of treasury SOC 1/2 audits, and regulatory portals consuming near-real-time treasury statements.

### Loanpool Programs (Score 30 / Tier F)
- **State of Play:** Loanpool underwriting relies on heuristic scoring without documented risk models, collateral valuations are manual, and disbursement approvals do not capture signature provenance. Liquidation workflows lack automation, risking systemic defaults.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Embed quantitative risk scoring, credit exposure dashboards, and configurable covenants across all loan classes.
  - Require notarized multi-party approvals for disbursements, capturing borrower metadata, collateral IDs, and compliance attestations.
  - Automate collateral liquidation triggers (price feeds, covenant breaches) with governance oversight and borrower notification protocols.
- **Validation Signals:** Back-tested loss provisioning, zero orphaned approvals in audit logs, and simulated liquidation drills executed within target SLAs.

### Charity & Impact Finance (Score 28 / Tier G)
- **State of Play:** Charity pool inflows/outflows lack standardized verification, enabling potential misallocation or sanctions breaches. Impact metrics rely on self-reported narratives without verifiable credentials or public attestations.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Require verifiable credentials (VCs) for beneficiary onboarding, AML/KYC, and ongoing eligibility checks anchored to the identity ledger.
  - Publish tamper-evident impact attestations (e.g., zk-SNARK backed) tied to disbursement events and third-party validators.
  - Integrate sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEP), and adverse media screening with periodic revalidation and alerting.
- **Validation Signals:** Independent NGO audits consuming on-chain attestations, zero sanctions match false negatives, and public dashboards evidencing disbursement-to-impact traceability.

### Gas Use & Execution Economics (Score 36 / Tier F)
- **State of Play:** Current gas tables were modeled on development workloads and do not reflect cross-chain, AI-assisted, or batched transaction realities. Metering bypasses exist on multi-call pathways, and opcode upgrades lack regression benchmarking, allowing DoS vectors and economic manipulation.
- **Upgrade Objectives:**
  - Re-benchmark every opcode and system call under production-like loads, aligning gas schedules with CPU/memory/IO profiles and publishing results.
  - Enforce metering invariants via runtime assertions, fuzz testing, and liveness monitors targeting multi-call and delegate-call patterns.
  - Establish upgrade guardrails that require economic regression reports, community review, and staged rollouts before gas schedule changes.
- **Validation Signals:** Successful completion of gas economics simulations without liveness failures, automated alerts on anomalous gas consumption, and signed governance artifacts accompanying every gas-table update.

## Next Steps
1. Assign accountable owners for each workstream and publish sprint backlogs.  
2. Stand up cross-functional program reviews every two weeks to validate progress against success metrics.  
3. Update this document upon completion of each milestone or discovery of new production blockers.
